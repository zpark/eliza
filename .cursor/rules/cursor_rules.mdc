# ElizaOS Master Development Guide

## 1. Core Development Principles

- **Plan First**: Always begin with a thorough plan. For bugs, identify the root cause and all affected files. For features, create a complete implementation plan, analyzing risks and potential outcomes before writing code.
- **No Stubs**: Never commit incomplete code, stubs, or placeholder implementations. Write complete, working features.
- **Test-Driven**: Verify all changes with comprehensive tests. The system is complex, and models can be unpredictable. Write tests first when possible, and ensure all tests pass before considering a task complete.

## 2. Package & Architecture Overview

ElizaOS is a monorepo containing several key packages. Understanding their roles is crucial.

-   `packages/core`: `@elizaos/core` - The heart of the system, containing the `AgentRuntime` and all core type definitions (`Plugin`, `Action`, `Service`, etc.). **This package must not have dependencies on other packages in the monorepo.**
-   `packages/cli`: The command-line interface. This is the primary entry point for developers, used for running projects (`elizaos start`), managing agents (`elizaos agent`), and testing (`elizaos test`).
-   `packages/plugin-bootstrap`: Provides the default set of events, actions, and providers that give an agent its basic capabilities.
-   `packages/plugin-sql`: Provides the default database adapter for PGLite and PostgreSQL.

## 3. The Plugin System

Plugins are the fundamental building blocks of the agent. Refer to [**Core Plugin Architecture**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_api_plugins_core.mdc) for a deep dive.

- **`Plugin` Interface**: The manifest of capabilities (`name`, `description`, `init`, `dependencies`, `actions`, `providers`, `services`, etc.).
- **Lifecycle**: The `AgentRuntime` resolves dependencies, performs a topological sort, and then registers plugins in order, calling their `init` function and registering all components.
- **Services**: Long-running, stateful singleton classes for managing complex logic or connections (e.g., a database connection pool, a WebSocket client). Accessed via `runtime.getService('service-name')`.
- **Actions**: Define what an agent *can do*. A function that gets executed when the LLM decides to take an action.
- **Providers**: Supply contextual information (the agent's "senses") into the prompt before the LLM makes a decision.

## 4. CLI Usage & Project Management

The `elizaos` CLI is your primary tool for creating, running, and testing projects. Refer to [**CLI Project Management**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_cli_project.mdc), [**Agent Management**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_cli_agents.mdc), and [**Configuration Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_cli_config.mdc) for details.

### Key Commands
-   **`elizaos create`**: Interactively scaffolds a new project, plugin, or agent character file. It sets up the directory structure, `package.json`, and initial `.env` file.
-   **`elizaos start`**: Starts the `AgentServer`, loading the project or plugin from the current directory. This is the main command for running your agent locally.
-   **`elizaos test`**: Runs the test suite. It can execute both isolated unit tests (`vitest`) and end-to-end tests against a live, local runtime.
-   **`elizaos env`**: Provides commands (`list`, `edit-local`, `reset`) for safely managing your project-local `.env` file.

### Configuration
- **`.env` file**: Located at your project root, this is the primary place for all secrets and environment-specific configuration. It is loaded into `process.env` at runtime. **Never commit this file.**
- **`runtime.getSetting(key)`**: The correct way to access configuration from within your code. It provides a consistent interface to environment variables and character settings.

## 5. Testing

ElizaOS employs a two-pronged testing strategy: Unit tests for isolation and E2E tests for integration.

### Unit Testing
Refer to the [**Unit Testing Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_testing_unit.mdc).
- **Framework**: `vitest`.
- **Goal**: Test a single function or component in complete isolation.
- **Technique**: Use `vi.mock` to mock all external dependencies, especially the `IAgentRuntime`. Create mock factories to provile ###esting
Refer to the [**E2E Testing Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/2_testing_e2e.mdc).
- **Frameworlizaos test` test runner.
- **Gointegration and interaction of multiple components in a live environment.
- **Technique**: Your test function receives a fully initialized, live `IAgentRuntime` instance. You can make real database calls, access running services, and validate the complete workflow. **Do not use mocks in E2E tests.**

## 6. API & On-Chain Integration

### External API Integration
Refer to the [**API Client Integration Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_api_client_integration.mdc).
- **Pattern**: Encapsulate all logic for a third-party API into a dedicated client module within your plugin.
- **Structure**: Separate concerns into `validator`, `builder`, and `request` functions.
- **Best Practices**: Use `axios` or `fetch`, handle authentication securely (via `runtime.getSetting`), manage errors gracefully (especially rate limits), and always set timeouts.

### LLM Provider Integration
Refer to the [**LLM Provider Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_api_llm_providers.mdc).
- **Pattern**: Create a plugin that registers a `ModelHandler` function for a specific `ModelType` (e.g., `TEXT_LARGE`).
- **Registration**: Use the `models` property on the `Plugin` interface. Set a `priority` to indicate preference over other providers.
- **Usage**: Other components should call `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_LARGE, params)` to invoke the LLM. The runtime automatically selects the highest-priority handler.

### On-Chain Plugin Integration
Refer to the [**On-Chain Plugin Guide**](mdc:.cursor/rules/elizaos_v2_onchain_plugins.mdc).
- **Pattern**: Use dedicated `Services` to manage `Connection` to an RPC node and to handle `Transaction` building, signing, and sending.
- **Security**: Key management is critical. **Never store private keys in code.** Load them securely from a secret store or environment variables at runtime via `runtime.getSetting`.
- **Abstraction**: On-chain actions should be abstracted into natural language capabilities for the agent (e.g., `transfer-spl-token`).
