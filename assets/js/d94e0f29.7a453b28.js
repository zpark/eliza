Jin mentioned two developers from defined.fi who have access to extensive data, including active chats, but noted deficiencies in marketing and social engagement. The group expressed interest in leveraging this data for AI training to identify potential scams or \"rugs\" in trading platforms like Dexscreener, which was reported as completed. Proposals were suggested to outline timelines, expectations, and mutual benefits between the parties involved.
