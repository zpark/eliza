Buzzman proposed an AAVE foundation-style approach where anyone can fork but joining the ai16z ecosystem offers exponential growth benefits, setting a benchmark for community-first sustainable funding in open source AI frameworks beyond Eliza and Marc. WhiteIris expressed interest in building agents to launch consumer product brands, while pspring questioned if this involved virtual 3D influencers. Basti suggested the idea of AI agents attempting \"hack\" attacks on each other for entertainment value.
