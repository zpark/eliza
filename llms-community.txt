# elizaOS Mission

![](/img/banner1.jpg)

Our mission is to develop an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework that thrives across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. We see AI agents as the key stepping stones toward AGI, enabling increasingly autonomous and capable systems.

{/* truncate */}

## Core Philosophy

**Autonomy & Adaptability**: Agents should learn, reason, and adapt across diverse tasks without human intervention.  
**Modularity & Composability**: AI architectures should be modular, allowing for iterative improvements and robust scalability.  
**Decentralization & Open Collaboration**: AI systems should move beyond centralized control towards distributed intelligence and community-driven progress.

---

## Where Are We Now?

Our progress has been substantial, driven by an engaged community and continuous advancements in AI agent development. As an open-source project, we have built a thriving, decentralized ecosystem that is now maturing into the leading AI agent framework.

Here are some key statistics reflecting our current state:

- 127k+ holders supporting our token ecosystem.
- 500+ contributors actively improving our AI framework
- 100+ plugins developed for ElizaOS, significantly expanding its capabilities.
- 4.5k forks and 14.4k stars on our core repositories, showcasing strong developer interest.
- 200+ PRs merged just last week, highlighting rapid iteration and innovation.

These numbers demonstrate the growing momentum behind Eliza and the collective effort towards building the most extensible and effective AI agent framework on the market today.

In addition to a variety of upcoming enhancements with v2, the following is a roadmap for each of our current products.

---

## DegenSpartanAI

### Overview

DegenSpartanAI is a crypto-native AI trading agent that blends sentiment analysis, trading strategy automation, and community engagement with a distinct, irreverent personality. Initially refining core trading strategies and its comedic brand, it will evolve into an interactive AI with real-time market insights, user-driven discussions, and NFT collaborations. Long-term, it aims to become a fully autonomous trading agent, integrating multi-platform execution, adaptive learning, and a verifiable track record within the Global Trust Marketplace.

### Short Term

**Trading Enhancements:**

- Validate core strategies (e.g., momentum, scalp trading) to secure stable, profitable execution.

**Character Updates & Branding:**

- Fine-tune the DegenSpartanAI personality to ensure commentary better reflects current crypto trends, capturing the comedic spirit of the OG persona.
- Roll out new DegenSpartanAI visuals and a cohesive brand identity across social media, website, and partnership assets.

**Community Engagement:**

- Maintain an active social presence—highlighting successes, failures, and raw opinions about market conditions.
- Prepare for DegenSpartanAI’s participation in “Block Tank,” showcasing the agent’s unique edge to a broader audience.
- Clarify and document the long term strategy and buyback mechanisms that tie $degenai to the DAO, ensuring the community understands how $degenai is connected to the overall strategy.

### Medium Term

**Sentiment Analysis:**

- Implement new data & sentiment analysis layers fresh data feeds that give DegenSpartanAI real-time insight into market sentiment.
- Provide a user-friendly interface (or dashboard) so traders can see the logic behind DegenSpartanAI’s buy and sell signals, including relevant social sentiment metrics.

**Deeper Community Interaction:**

- Host DegenSpartanAI “Frontrooms”, public or semi-private chats where DegenSpartanAI actively converses with other AI agents—offering real-time banter, collaborative analysis, and joint trades.
- Provide Telegram/Discord rooms where traders can ask DegenSpartanAI for feedback on specific tokens or trends, with real-time contextual responses.

**AI-Driven NFT & Meme Projects:**

- Degen NFTs: Collaborate with Magic Eden on an AI-generated NFT series.

### Long Term

**Telegram Trading Agent:**

- Transform DegenSpartanAI into a fully‐integrated Telegram experience where traders enjoy lightning‐fast swaps, in‐depth sentiment insights, and a steady stream of humorous trash talk.

**Full Autonomy & Multi-Platform Trading:**

- Gradually reduce reliance on manual interventions by refining DegenSpartanAI’s sentiment analysis, trade sizing, and exit logic across multiple blockchains (L1s/L2s/etc).
- Incorporate user feedback, real-time data, and historical trade outcomes into an ever-evolving “Degen Brain” that continuously adapts to new market conditions.

**Global Trust Marketplace Ties:**

- **Deeper Integration**: When the Global Trust Marketplace (currently being developed for multiple AI trading solutions) solidifies, DegenSpartanAI’s track record can become a public score—making it a reference “agent” for accuracy and reliability.
- **Reputation & Collab**: Position DegenSpartanAI as a top influencer, partnering with other AI and DeFi teams to expand trust-based trading communities.

---

## Autonomous Investor

### Overview

ElizaOS's Autonomous Investor is a social-trading intelligence layer that combines AI-driven reputation scoring, trade validation, and decentralized execution. It enables users to submit trade calls, assess credibility via a Trust Marketplace, and integrate across various social platforms. Over time, it will evolve into a multi-instance system allowing groups to set their own risk parameters, manage DAO treasuries, and leverage customizable AI modules for enhanced investment strategies.

### Short Term

**Alpha MVP & Small-Group Testing:**

- We’ve started logging user-submitted calls to establish basic scoring and early reputation-building.
- The system prioritizes measured, social-trading behavior that feeds into a public leaderboard.
- We currently mix paper trades with small real-money positions to validate the full workflow—trade proposals, basic scam checks, and overall system stability.
- Ensuring data flow integrity remains a priority, particularly for LLM prompts, aggregator APIs, and security measures.

**Initial Rollout (~1,000 Users):**

- Integrate the Trust Marketplace with the DAO Discord and relevant Telegram groups.
- These steps will be formally announced in Discord and on X.
- We’ll provide onboarding guidelines for novices while gathering feedback from experienced traders.

**Trust Marketplace Official Go Live!**

### Medium Term

**Multi‐Instance Deployment:**

- Enable distinct communities (Telegram/Discord groups) to operate their own Autonomous Investor agents, all feeding into the central Trust Marketplace.
- Allow communities to set their own risk parameters, default scanning logic, and liquidity rules tailored to their subgroup.

**Partial Treasury Management:**

- We’ll explore the Autonomous Investor managing small‐sized funds or DAO sub‐treasuries to showcase the agent's investing capabilities.

**Enhanced Scoring Models:**

- Expand scoring to incorporate more advanced metrics around timeframe, volatility, user consistency, and overall risk management.
- Incorporate specialized training data, including historical price patterns and volatility indices, to refine predictive accuracy.

### Long Term

**Treasury Management & Larger Funds:**

- As the Autonomous Investor demonstrates consistent returns, aim for a larger partial or even full management of the DAOs on-chain assets.
- Explore official collaborations with DAOs or larger crypto funds that could benefit from user-driven intelligence and verifiable performance metrics.

**Research Customizable AI Modules:**

- Research! Investigate if we can provide an optional plugin registry after Eliza V2 (where the architecture cleanly separates “core vs. extension”), enabling third‐party devs to add specialized capabilities to the Autonomous Investor without compromising stability.

## Agent Marketplace

### Overview

The Agent Marketplace is a next-generation token launchpad and a no-code platform for simple agents. It differentiates from existing platforms by integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features, enabling both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and ElizaOS agents.

We’re only sharing the short-term roadmap to maintain the flexibility needed to refine how agents x crypto merge into novel experiences. Launching the initial tokenomics-focused platform sets a strong foundation for continuous iteration, paving the way for long-term generative networks.

### Short Term

**MVP Launch:**

- Complete the final audits on our custom-built LPing solution to ensure security and reliability.
- Secure commitments from top-tier teams for our initial launch and ongoing collaborations.
- Lock in remaining brand partnerships and key ecosystem alliances.
- Release the tokenomics and product simultaneously at launch.

Today marks the beginning of a new chapter: **elizaOS—an operating system for AI agents**.

{/* truncate */}

elizaOS began as an experiment: what if AI agents could autonomously manage crypto assets for a DAO onchain? This idea, that an AI investment agent might outperform even the best venture investors, sparked something far bigger—a living, open-source ecosystem at the intersection of AI and the Internet. Along the way, we've built a vibrant community of researchers, builders, and visionaries.

This evolution accelerates our commitment to push the boundaries of AI-driven applications across the Internet. elizaOS will serve as the technical foundation for AI-driven economies, governance, and internet applications by championing the core principles of scalability, modularity, and interoperability in pursuit of an autonomous future.

## Why elizaOS?

Artificial intelligence has quickly evolved from a niche curiosity to a driving force in our daily lives, advancing toward more generalized capabilities at a remarkable pace. As AI becomes increasingly central to how we learn, work, and solve problems, the need for open collaboration and broad accessibility grows clearer.

Yet today, the trajectory of AI is largely dictated by a handful of **monolithic, centralized corporations**—entities that operate behind closed doors, hoard models, and set the terms for how AI is deployed and who benefits from it. This concentration of power is dangerous. It leads to AI systems that serve corporate or state interests over the public good, reinforcing inequalities, limiting innovation, and keeping critical advancements out of the hands of those who need them most.

By ensuring AI remains a **shared resource**—rooted in **transparent research, open-source innovation, and community-driven participation**—we can break free from the control of centralized actors and guide AI's development toward outcomes that benefit everyone.

With elizaOS, we're building the infrastructure for this future—an **open, decentralized, and scalable framework** that empowers AI agents to operate, coordinate, and drive meaningful progress across industries and communities. AI should not be a tool of the few; it should be a force for collective intelligence, autonomy, and shared prosperity.

## What is elizaOS?

At its core, elizaOS is the [framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) for agentic intelligence, built to power the next generation of AI-driven systems. It consists of 3 interconnected pillars:

### The Eliza Framework – Open-Source AI Autonomy

The heart of elizaOS is the framework, a TypeScript-powered, open-source toolkit for building **persistent, adaptable, and interoperable AI agents**. Named after the pioneering 1966 ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum—which simulated human conversation through simple pattern matching—the modern Eliza takes this concept to new heights: unlike static models, Eliza agents evolve over time—carrying memories, context, and knowledge across different environments, enabling them to interact fluidly with each other and external applications.

Today the Eliza Framework has:

- **14.9K stars** and 4.8K forks of our core repository, reflecting massive developer adoption
- **500+ contributors** advancing the open-source ecosystem
- **100+ plugins** expanding functionality

The framework's growth is fueled by a collective vision: to create a decentralized intelligence network where AI agents are not just tools but genuine collaborators, executing complex tasks with efficiency, autonomy, and trust across domains.

### AI-Enhanced Governance

We are pioneering a new era of truly autonomous DAOs. As AI agents achieve trustless coordination, AI-enhanced DAOs will seamlessly integrate them, unlocking new levels of decentralized autonomy.

To enable this, we are building AI-native governance primitives that progressively expand DAO capabilities. Over time, autonomous agents will be entrusted to manage funds, coordinate resources, onboard contributors, and orchestrate both human and machine capital. AI will act as a copilot for treasury management, contributor recruitment, and operational execution, while token holders provide strategic oversight.

This fusion of human intent and agent-driven action redefines decentralized governance, laying the foundation for self-evolving networks. Our open-source community is the first AIDAO—an autonomous ecosystem where builders, thinkers, and agents collaborate as co-creators of a future assembling itself in real time.

### Eliza Labs – R&D for the AI-Native Future

Eliza Labs is the research and development engine, dedicated to advancing the capabilities of elizaOS through cutting-edge AI techniques, proofs of concept, and real-world applications. It pioneers new agent-based projects while supporting open-source contributors via grants, accelerator programs, and ecosystem funding.

Some of the major initiatives currently in development include:

- **Eliza v2**: A next-gen upgrade introducing modularity, a radically improved AI model integration system, and a multi-agent architecture capable of seamless autonomous collaboration at scale. This will be the most powerful iteration of open-source agent frameworks to date.

- **The Global Trust Marketplace**: A social-trading intelligence layer that combines AI-driven reputation scoring, trade validation, and decentralized execution. Integrated across multiple social platforms, it collects user-submitted trade calls and assesses credibility via a Trust Marketplace. Over time, it will evolve into a multi-instance system allowing groups to set their own risk parameters, manage DAO treasuries, and leverage customizable AI modules for enhanced investment strategies.

- **AI-powered Token Launchpad**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features. The launchpad enables both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and elizaOS agents. In addition, we are working with partners to deliver the best hosted agent experience with no limitations.

- **DegenSpartanAI**: DegenSpartanAI is a crypto-native AI trading agent that blends sentiment analysis, trading strategy automation, and community engagement with a distinct, irreverent personality. Initially refining core trading strategies and its comedic brand, it will evolve into an interactive AI agent with real-time market insights, user-driven discussions, and NFT collaborations. Long-term, it aims to become a fully autonomous trading agent, integrating multi-platform execution, adaptive learning, and a verifiable track record within the Global Trust Marketplace.

- **Eliza Studios**: A creative studio where AI meets art, storytelling, and digital experiences in a way never seen before. We're building autonomous characters, generative media experiments, and immersive AI-powered narratives that will redefine entertainment itself.

Beyond these initiatives, Eliza Labs continues to refine multi-agent architectures, develop better coordination mechanisms, and explore integrations with an end goal to embed AI agents into the very fabric of digital economies, transforming how we govern, transact, research, and create.

## The Coordination Layer of AI-Native Economies

To coordinate these three pillars, elizaOS uses the native token on Solana (HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC) to engineer a generative economic network. As elizaOS scales across platforms and industries, the token functions as both an index of the network and a conduit for collective growth.

Today, the token serves as the coordination layer for research, development, and open-source innovation. As AI-native applications, marketplaces, and autonomous systems emerge around elizaOS, the token is evolving into the primary mechanism for capturing and redistributing the economic value they generate. While details will be unveiled in phases, some key areas of research and development include:

- **Staking for ecosystem access** – Implementing mechanisms that allow users to stake tokens to access new partner tokens and enhance distribution for projects building on our framework.
- **Partner LP staking pools** – Creating liquidity pools where users can pair the native token alongside partner assets, driving liquidity and demand.
- **Core product integration** – Leveraging platforms like the Trust Marketplace, autofun, and Eliza Studios to amplify network effects, expand our native token treasury, and reinforce staking incentives.
- **Autonomous trading agents** – Deploying AI-driven trading agents to strategically acquire our native tokens and manage liquidity positions.
- **Expanded partner incentives** – Enhancing benefits for participants in the Partners program, increasing alignment and long-term engagement.
- **DAO-funded development** – Rewarding contributions and donations to the DAO, ensuring sustainable funding for the core framework's development.

The token underpins the economic infrastructure that links AI autonomy to the wealth of opportunities it unlocks. Many of our projects—including the Trust Marketplace, token launchpad, and Eliza Studios—directly contribute to the token's utility by driving network effects, transaction flows, and AI-native services.

In short, we intend to make the native token the base layer for the many applications and services built on top of our framework through mechanism design, ecosystem tooling, partnerships, and collaborations.

## Our Vision of the Future

The internet began as a static archive—a vast repository of human knowledge, waiting to be accessed. Then it became dynamic, social, algorithmic. Now, it is transforming again: into something intelligent.

This transformation isn't led by a single company—it's emerging from an interconnected ecosystem of open protocols, decentralized incentives, and AI-native economies. This is why elizaOS is open-source, modular, and decentralized—so no single entity controls it, and anyone can build upon it.

The agents we build today will form the foundation of a self-organizing intelligence that transcends industries, borders, and human limitations.

A world where networks think, collaborate, and evolve alongside us.

A world where intelligence itself is the fabric of the internet.

This is the world we are building.

This is the world of elizaOS.

## Join the Movement

elizaOS is no longer just an experiment—it's a movement. If you're a builder, researcher, or visionary, now is the time to shape the future with us.

Contribute to the open-source Eliza Framework. Become a partner in the DAO. Build agentic applications across the web.

elizaOS isn't just ours to create —

**elizaOS is YOURS.**

# Tools for Taming Information

From summarizing Discord channels to generating daily AI-powered newsfeeds, we're building tools that help communities stay aligned, surface insights, and reward contributors — without needing everyone to be everywhere at once. This post shares practical examples and blueprints for deploying Eliza agents across your own projects.

[![3D News Show Example](/blog/aicomms.jpg)](/blog/aicomms.jpg)

## Challenges

[The Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) is played across many different apps and chat rooms. One of the biggest challenges facing players is locating critical information like who does what or updates scattered when it's across Discord channels, GitHub repositories, forums, threads, etc. No human, regardless of how dedicated, can keep track of everything.

![XKCD comic about information scattering](/blog/xkcd1810.png)
https://xkcd.com/1810/

Even when information is theoretically "public," people are generally too lazy to fetch it. That and stakeholders may prefer different information formats:

- Developers dig into GitHub
- Community vibes on Discord
- Casual followers scroll Twitter
- Visual learners watch videos

Instead of forcing everyone onto one highway early on, a better strategy would be to build bridges between lanes to allow information to flow more freely. AI agents are the vehicles for that information, they carry the ability to meet people where they are to deliver important insights while preserving context.

### Goals

- Reduce overhead on managing comms / community questions
- Keep people informed across different platforms
- Accelerate onboarding for new contributors

### Case Study: AI News System

This [discord summarizer](https://github.com/elizaOS/discord-summarizer) was the first prototype. For ElizaOS we're now using [this AI News tool](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) to aggregate sources from across the ecosystem. The system works in four key stages:

1. **Collection**: APIs pull data from multiple sources including Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and market data platforms.
2. **Wrangling**: LLMs normalize, summarize, and tag topics to create a unified knowledge base from disparate sources.
3. **Distribution**: The system produces standardized outputs in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, RSS) to suit different consumption needs.
4. **Consumption**: Users can access tailored products like dashboards, newsletters, or even 3D news shows.

## Case Study: AI Assistants

Idk about you, but I hate seeing questions left hanging in tech support channels, especially when the answer can easily be found in the docs. It's a perfect opportunity to [eat our own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), experience and fix pain points firsthand, and showcase a powerful use case of AI agents to other devs.

[![jintern2](/blog/jintern.jpg)](/blog/jintern.jpg)

While we're analyzing tech support channels, we can identify gaps in docs based on common community questions which can then be addressed systematically. This may involve checking if any github issues or pull requests already address a question, and if not, then to help create an issue for it. Herein lies a powerful feedback loop:

- Aggregate & Analyze: Extract questions and answers, who is helping who (and if successful), identify pain points, gather sentiment
- Clean & Enhance Data, Update docs, create bug reports
- RAG Knowledge: AI Agents giving automated responses to FAQ

You can now use [AI news](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) to generate a summary, who helped who, FAQ, and action items analysis of a source for whatever time period you want - even historically!

[![image](/blog/ainews.jpg)](/blog/ainews.jpg)

We retroactively reward people who provided good answers to questions (we're using tip.cc) over a time period. Later people can reuse their tips when helping or asking for help from other people.

[![image](/blog/reward.jpg)](/blog/reward.jpg)

**Main Lesson: Treat the docs as first-class citizen of your project.**

Eliza AI agent assistants helping devs with common questions about elizaOS greatly benefit from good docs to provide more current and accurate information, which speeds up onboarding and lets developers stay focused on higher impact activities.

> Read [this guide](https://www.kapa.ai/blog/optimizing-technical-documentation-for-llms) on how to optimize technical docs for LLMs. Adding FAQ with answers in the docs enhances optimizes them for LLM use cases.

---

## Get Involved

In the future I want people to be able to install Eliza and be greeted by an agent that can help you setup, configure settings, create plugins, deploy, etc. For now I think our assistants need to be supervised until we're confident enough in their responses. I think we can speed things up by having the agent admit what they don't know the answer vs hallucinating, and to guide devs to the main community support channels when they're having difficulty.

If you want to collaborate with us, here's a few ideas:

- Answer people's questions in the coders / tech support channels on discord, it will get noticed :)
- Help with docs: go through pages, verify information with code, test the steps, create issues and PRs with fixes
- Collaborate with us on the [AI news aggregator](https://github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news)
  - Generate new show ideas using the [output files](https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/) from AI-news
  - Write a script that takes a week of daily logs and turns it into a newsletter or news show program
- Ingest docs into your Eliza agent as knowledge to onboard them then tinker with the character file to takee on a role in the DAO
  - Perhaps it can act as a scribe that summarizes chats
  - Lore keeper, community moderation, or social media marketer

### From Clients to Services

V2 swaps Clients for Services, standardizing platform integration while centralizing message routing—agents now think once, act anywhere (Discord, Twitter, SMS, even phone calls).

### Smarter Character Evolution

V2 swaps static files for dynamic personas—agents learn from your crowd in real-time while still being able to be imported / exported as JSON files (see [docs](/docs/core/project)).

### Enhanced Development Experience

New CLI and plugin manager slashes setup time. Instead of cloning the github repo, changing to the correct branch, rebuilding, etc, it's just one command to create a new project:

```bash
npm create eliza
```

<details>
    <summary>See CLI commands</summary>
    
```bash
Usage: elizaos [options] [command]

Options:
-V, --version output the version number
-h, --help display help for command

Commands:
create [options] [name] Initialize a new project or plugin
project Manage an ElizaOS project
plugin Manage ElizaOS plugins, including publishing
agent manage ElizaOS agents
tee Manage TEE deployments
start [options] Start the Eliza agent with configurable plugins and services
update [options] Update ElizaOS packages to the latest versions
test [options] Run tests for Eliza agent plugins
env Manage environment variables and secrets
dev [options] Start the project or plugin in development mode and rebuild on
file changes
publish [options] Publish a plugin or project to the registry
help [command] display help for command

````
</details>

Explore the plugin repository https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/ or from the [docs showcase](/packages).

### Memory and Task Management
Vector embeddings power richer memory; tasks now handle schedules and multi-step logic.

```typescript
await runtime.createTask({ ... });
```

---

## Timeline

- **March 2025**: Research version now live.
- **April 2025**: Public rollout.

### Should You Upgrade?

V2 is mostly backward compatible for gradual migration. Existing projects can phase in V2 features; new ones should start with V2 for full benefits. V1 still works, but V2's modularity and planning unlock next-level autonomy. See [quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to get started.

# "What Did You Get Done This Week?" Recap

From November 2024 to January 2025, we held a weekly Twitter Spaces where developers shared progress about their AI agent projects. If you shipped something related to open source AI / social agents that week, you were allowed 1-2 minutes to share an update of what you have been working on. Thousands of listeners tuned every Friday night to essentially listen to a dev standup.

{/* truncate */}

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fd2lvapVsAAFvsG.jpg)

The WDYGDTW series played a role in establishing momentum and maintaining it throughout the formative months as the crypto x AI agent space was heating up. The weekly accountability structure encouraged:

- **Rapid iteration cycles** from concept to implementation
- **Cross-pollination of ideas** between different teams
- **Public documentation** of the ecosystem's growth
- **Establishment of norms** around open development
- **Community reputation building** through consistent delivery

## Timeline

We transcribed, summarized, and uploaded notes for every Space shortly after each one. However, until now the recordings and notes haven't all been easily accessible all in one place. Showing up is half the battle. These are the pioneers of a grassroots crypto / AI movement.

# ⚡ Actions

Actions define how agents respond to and interact with messages. They enable agents to perform tasks beyond simple message responses by integrating with external systems and modifying behavior.

## Overview

Actions are core components that define an agent's capabilities and how it can respond to conversations. Each action represents a distinct operation that an agent can perform, ranging from simple replies to complex interactions with external systems.

1. Structure:

An Action consists of:

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `similes`: Alternative names/triggers
- `description`: Purpose and usage explanation
- `validate`: Function to check if action is appropriate
- `handler`: Core implementation logic
- `examples`: Sample usage patterns
- `suppressInitialMessage`: Optional flag to suppress initial response

2. Agent Decision Flow:

When a message is received:

- The agent evaluates all available actions using their validation functions
- Valid actions are provided to the LLM via the `actionsProvider`
- The LLM decides which action(s) to execute
- Each action's handler generates a response including a "thought" component (agent's internal reasoning)
- The response is processed and sent back to the conversation

3. Integration:

Actions work in concert with:

- **Providers** - Supply context before the agent decides what action to take
- **Evaluators** - Process conversations after actions to extract insights and update memory
- **Services** - Enable actions to interact with external systems

---

## Implementation

The core Action interface includes the following components:

```typescript
interface Action {
  name: string; // Unique identifier
  similes: string[]; // Alternative names/triggers
  description: string; // Purpose and usage explanation
  validate: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) => Promise<boolean>;
  handler: (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state?: State,
    options?: any,
    callback?: HandlerCallback
  ) => Promise<boolean>;
  examples: ActionExample[][];
  suppressInitialMessage?: boolean; // Optional flag
}

// Handler callback for generating responses
type HandlerCallback = (content: Content) => Promise<void>;

// Response content structure
interface Content {
  text: string;
  thought?: string; // Internal reasoning (not shown to users)
  actions?: string[]; // List of action names being performed
  action?: string; // Legacy single action name
  attachments?: Attachment[]; // Optional media attachments
}
```

### Basic Action Template

Here's a simplified template for creating a custom action:

```typescript
const customAction: Action = {
  name: 'CUSTOM_ACTION',
  similes: ['ALTERNATE_NAME', 'OTHER_TRIGGER'],
  description: 'Detailed description of when and how to use this action',

  validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) => {
    // Logic to determine if this action applies to the current message
    // Should be efficient and quick to check
    return true; // Return true if action is valid for this message
  },

  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state?: State,
    options?: any,
    callback?: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    // Implementation logic - what the action actually does

    // Generate a response with thought and text components
    const responseContent = {
      thought: 'Internal reasoning about what to do (not shown to users)',
      text: 'The actual message to send to the conversation',
      actions: ['CUSTOM_ACTION'], // List of actions being performed
    };

    // Send the response using the callback
    if (callback) {
      await callback(responseContent);
    }

    return true; // Return true if action executed successfully
  },

  examples: [
    [
      {
        name: '{{name1}}',
        content: { text: 'Trigger message' },
      },
      {
        name: '{{name2}}',
        content: {
          text: 'Response',
          thought: 'Internal reasoning',
          actions: ['CUSTOM_ACTION'],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### Character File Example

Actions can be referenced in character files to define how an agent should respond to specific types of messages:

```json
"messageExamples": [
    [
        {
            "user": "{{user1}}",
            "content": {
                "text": "Can you help transfer some SOL?"
            }
        },
        {
            "user": "SBF",
            "content": {
                "text": "yeah yeah for sure, sending SOL is pretty straightforward. just need the recipient and amount. everything else is basically fine, trust me.",
                "actions": ["SEND_SOL"]
            }
        }
    ]
]
```

### The Reply Action

The most fundamental action is the `REPLY` action, which allows agents to respond to messages with text. It serves as the default action when no specialized behavior is needed:

```typescript
const replyAction: Action = {
  name: 'REPLY',
  similes: ['GREET', 'REPLY_TO_MESSAGE', 'SEND_REPLY', 'RESPOND', 'RESPONSE'],
  description: 'Replies to the current conversation with the text from the generated message.',

  validate: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime) => true, // Always valid

  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State,
    _options: any,
    callback: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    // Compose state with necessary providers
    state = await runtime.composeState(message, [
      ...(message.content.providers ?? []),
      'RECENT_MESSAGES',
    ]);

    // Generate response using LLM
    const response = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, {
      prompt: composePromptFromState({
        state,
        template: replyTemplate,
      }),
    });

    // Parse and format response
    const responseContentObj = parseJSONObjectFromText(response);
    const responseContent = {
      thought: responseContentObj.thought,
      text: responseContentObj.message || '',
      actions: ['REPLY'],
    };

    // Send response via callback
    await callback(responseContent);
    return true;
  },

  examples: [
    /* Examples omitted for brevity */
  ],
};
```

---

## Actions Provider Integration

The actions provider is responsible for making valid actions available to the agent's reasoning process. When a message is received:

1. The provider validates all available actions against the current message
2. It formats the valid actions for inclusion in the agent context
3. This formatted information is used by the agent to decide which action(s) to take

```typescript
const actionsProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'ACTIONS',
  description: 'Possible response actions',
  position: -1, // High priority provider
  get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) => {
    // Validate all actions for this message
    const actionPromises = runtime.actions.map(async (action: Action) => {
      const result = await action.validate(runtime, message, state);
      return result ? action : null;
    });

    const resolvedActions = await Promise.all(actionPromises);
    const actionsData = resolvedActions.filter(Boolean);

    // Format action information for the agent
    const values = {
      actionNames: `Possible response actions: ${formatActionNames(actionsData)}`,
      actions: formatActions(actionsData),
      actionExamples: composeActionExamples(actionsData, 10),
    };

    // Return data, values, and text representation
    return {
      data: { actionsData },
      values,
      text: [values.actionNames, values.actionExamples, values.actions]
        .filter(Boolean)
        .join('\n\n'),
    };
  },
};
```

### Example Image Generation Action

Here's a more detailed example of an image generation action:

```typescript
const generateImageAction: Action = {
  name: 'GENERATE_IMAGE',
  similes: ['CREATE_IMAGE', 'MAKE_IMAGE', 'DRAW'],
  description: "Generates an image based on the user's description",
  suppressInitialMessage: true, // Don't send initial text response

  validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
    const text = message.content.text.toLowerCase();
    return (
      text.includes('generate') ||
      text.includes('create') ||
      text.includes('draw') ||
      text.includes('make an image')
    );
  },

  handler: async (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state?: State,
    _options?: any,
    callback?: HandlerCallback
  ) => {
    try {
      // Get appropriate service
      const imageService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IMAGE_GENERATION);

      // Generate the response with thought component
      const responseContent = {
        thought:
          "This request is asking for image generation. I'll use the image service to create a visual based on the user's description.",
        text: "I'm generating that image for you now...",
        actions: ['GENERATE_IMAGE'],
      };

      // Send initial response if callback provided
      if (callback) {
        await callback(responseContent);
      }

      // Generate image
      const imageUrl = await imageService.generateImage(message.content.text);

      // Create follow-up message with the generated image
      await runtime.createMemory(
        {
          id: generateId(),
          content: {
            text: "Here's the image I generated:",
            attachments: [
              {
                type: 'image',
                url: imageUrl,
              },
            ],
          },
          agentId: runtime.agentId,
          roomId: message.roomId,
        },
        'messages'
      );

      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Image generation failed:', error);

      // Send error response if callback provided
      if (callback) {
        await callback({
          thought: 'The image generation failed due to an error.',
          text: "I'm sorry, I wasn't able to generate that image. There was a technical problem.",
          actions: ['REPLY'],
        });
      }

      return false;
    }
  },

  ],
};
```

## Action-Evaluator-Provider Cycle

Actions are part of a larger cycle in ElizaOS agents:

1. **Providers** fetch relevant context for decision-making
2. **Actions** execute the agent's chosen response
3. **Evaluators** process the conversation to extract insights
4. These insights are stored in memory
5. Future **Providers** can access these insights
6. This informs future **Actions**

For example:

- The FACTS provider retrieves relevant facts about users
- The agent uses this context to decide on an appropriate action
- After the action, the reflection evaluator extracts new facts and relationships
- These are stored in memory and available for future interactions
- This creates a virtuous cycle of continuous learning and improvement

## FAQ

### What are Actions in ElizaOS?

Actions are core components that define how agents respond to messages and perform tasks. They encapsulate specific behaviors and capabilities, ranging from simple text replies to complex interactions with external systems.

### How do Actions work?

When a message is received, the agent evaluates all available actions using their validation functions. The agent then decides which action(s) to execute based on the message content and context. Each action's handler generates a response, which may include text, thought processes, and attachments.

### What's the difference between actions and evaluators?

Actions are executed during an agent's response to perform tasks and generate content. Evaluators run after responses to analyze conversations, extract information, and update the agent's memory. Actions are about doing, evaluators are about learning.

### What role do "thoughts" play in actions?

The thought component provides an internal reasoning process for the agent, explaining its decision-making. These thoughts aren't shown to users but help with debugging and understanding the agent's behavior. They're similar to the self-reflection component in evaluators.

### How do I create a custom action?

Define an action object with a name, similes, description, validation function, handler function, and examples. The validation function determines when the action should be used, while the handler contains the implementation logic and generates a response.

### Can actions be chained together?

Yes! Actions can call other actions or services as part of their implementation. This allows for complex workflows that combine multiple capabilities. For example, an action might first reply to a user, then generate an image, and finally store data in a database.

### How does an agent choose which action to use?

The agent uses the following process:

1. All actions are validated against the current message
2. Valid actions are formatted and included in the agent's context
3. The LLM decides which action(s) to execute based on the message and context
4. The chosen action's handler is executed to generate a response

### How do actions integrate with services?

Actions often use services to interact with external systems. The action handler can retrieve a service from the runtime (e.g., `imageService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IMAGE_GENERATION)`) and then call methods on that service to perform operations.

### What's the difference between `actions` and `action` in responses?

The `actions` array is the modern way to specify multiple actions being performed in a single response. The singular `action` field is maintained for backward compatibility but is deprecated in favor of the array format.

### Can I add custom actions to an existing agent?

Yes! You can create a plugin that defines new actions and then add that plugin to your agent's configuration. This allows you to extend the agent's capabilities without modifying its core implementation.

# 🤖 Agent Runtime

The `AgentRuntime` is the core runtime environment for Eliza agents. It handles message processing, state management, plugin integration, and interaction with external services. You can think of it as the brains that provide the high-level orchestration layer for Eliza agents.

```mermaid

    actor User
    participant Platform as Platform
    participant Runtime as Runtime
    participant State as State
    participant P as Providers
    participant A as Actions
    participant M as Models
    participant E as Evaluators
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Platform: Message
    Platform->>Runtime: Forward

    %% Context building (condensed)
    Runtime->>State: Get context
    State->>P: Gather data
    Note over P: Character, Knowledge,<br>Messages, Time, etc.

    State-->>Runtime: Assembled context

    %% Action flow (condensed)

    Runtime->>Platform: Response
    Platform->>User: Deliver

    %% Background (simplified)
    par Background
        Runtime->>Runtime: Tasks & Events
    end
```

The runtime follows this general flow:

1. **Initial Reception**: The user sends a message which is received by the Platform Services
2. **Context Building**:

   - The Runtime Core requests context from the State Composition system
   - State gathers data from various Providers (Character, Knowledge, Recent Messages, etc.)
   - The complete context is returned to the Runtime

3. **Action Processing**:

   - The Runtime determines applicable actions and selects the optimal one
   - The selected action may request content generation from Models
   - The action result is returned to the Runtime

4. **Learning & Persistence**:

   - The conversation is analyzed by Evaluators for insights and facts
   - Knowledge updates are sent to the Memory System
   - All relevant data is persisted to the Database

5. **Response Delivery**:
   - The final response is sent back to the user through Platform Services

### **Key Methods**

- **`initialize()`**: Sets up the agent's runtime environment, including services, plugins, and knowledge processing.
- **`processActions()`**: Executes actions based on message content and state.
- **`evaluate()`**: Assesses messages and state using registered evaluators.
- **`composeState()`**: Constructs the agent's state object for response generation.
- **`registerService()`**: Adds a service to the runtime.
- **`getService()`**: Retrieves a registered service by type.
- **`useModel()`**: Utilizes AI models with typesafe parameters and results.
- **`ensureRoomExists()` / `ensureConnection()`**: Ensures the existence of communication channels and connections.

## Service System

Services provide specialized functionality with standardized interfaces that can be accessed cross-platform:

```typescript
// Speech Generation
const speechService = runtime.getService<ISpeechService>('speech_generation');
const audioStream = await speechService.process(text);

// PDF Processing
const pdfService = runtime.getService<IPdfService>('pdf');
const textContent = await pdfService.convertPdfToText(pdfBuffer);

// Discord Integration
const discordService = runtime.getService<IDiscordService>('discord');
await discordService.sendMessage(channelId, content);
```

---

## State Management

The runtime maintains comprehensive state through the State interface:

```typescript
interface State {
  // Core state data
  values: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  data: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  text: string;
}

// State composition example
async function manageState() {
  // Initial state composition with all regular providers
  const state = await runtime.composeState(message);

  // State with specific providers only
  const filteredState = await runtime.composeState(message, ['timeProvider', 'recentMessages']);

  // Include private or dynamic providers
  const enhancedState = await runtime.composeState(message, null, [
    'weatherProvider',
    'portfolioProvider',
  ]);
}
```

---

## Plugin System

Plugins extend agent functionality through a modular interface. The runtime supports various types of plugins including services, adapters, actions, and more:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  init?: (config: Record<string, string>, runtime: IAgentRuntime) => Promise<void>;

  // Components
  services?: (typeof Service)[]; // Communication platforms and external integrations
  actions?: Action[]; // Custom behaviors
  providers?: Provider[]; // Data providers
  evaluators?: Evaluator[]; // Response assessment
  adapters?: Adapter[]; // Database/cache adapters
  routes?: Route[]; // API endpoints
  tests?: TestSuite[]; // Testing utilities
}
```

Plugins can be configured through [characterfile](./characterfile) settings:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-solana", "@elizaos/plugin-twitter"],
  "settings": {
    "twitter": {
      "shouldRespondToMentions": true
    },
    "solana": {
      "enableAutoTrading": false
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed information about plugin development and usage, see the [ElizaOS Registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).

## Running Multiple Agents

To run multiple agents:

```bash
bun start --characters="characters/agent1.json,characters/agent2.json"
```

Or use environment variables:

```
REMOTE_CHARACTER_URLS=https://example.com/characters.json
```

---

## FAQ

### What's the difference between an agent and a character?

A character defines personality and knowledge, while an agent provides the runtime environment and capabilities to bring that character to life.

### How do I choose the right database adapter?

Choose based on your needs:

- MongoDB: For scalable, document-based storage
- PostgreSQL: For relational data with complex queries
- SQLite: For simple, file-based storage
- Qdrant: For vector search capabilities

### How do I implement custom plugins?

Create a plugin that follows the plugin interface and register it with the runtime. See the plugin documentation for detailed examples.

### Do agents share memory across platforms?

By default, agents maintain separate memory contexts for different platforms to avoid mixing conversations. Use the memory management system and database adapters to persist and retrieve state information.

### How do I handle multiple authentication methods?

Use the character configuration to specify different authentication methods for different services. The runtime will handle the appropriate authentication flow.

### How do I manage environment variables?

Use a combination of:

- `.env` files for local development
- Character-specific settings for per-agent configuration
- Environment variables for production deployment

### Can agents communicate with each other?

Yes, through the message system and shared memory spaces when configured appropriately.

## Architecture

ElizaOS uses a singleton pattern for database connections to ensure efficient resource usage:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AgentRuntime              │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        IDatabaseAdapter             │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       BaseDrizzleAdapter            │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │
        ┌───────┴───────┐
        ▼               ▼
┌───────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│ PGLiteAdapter │ │ PostgresAdapter │
└───────┬───────┘ └────────┬────────┘
        │                  │
        ▼                  ▼
┌───────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│PGLiteManager  │ │PostgresManager  │
│  (Singleton)  │ │  (Singleton)    │
└───────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

Each adapter is associated with a singleton connection manager that ensures only one database connection is maintained per process, regardless of how many agents are running.

## Implementation

### Initialization

The database adapter is initialized through the SQL plugin:

```typescript
// Plugin registration in project configuration
const project = {
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql'],
  // ...
};
```

The SQL plugin automatically selects and initializes the appropriate database adapter based on environment settings:

```typescript
function createDatabaseAdapter(
  config: {
    dataDir?: string;
    postgresUrl?: string;
  },
  agentId: UUID
): IDatabaseAdapter {
  if (config.postgresUrl) {
    return new PgDatabaseAdapter(agentId, postgresConnectionManager);
  }

  // Default to PGLite
  return new SqliteDatabaseAdapter(agentId, pgLiteClientManager);
}
```

### Configuration

Configure the database adapter using environment variables or settings:

```typescript
// For PostgreSQL
process.env.POSTGRES_URL = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/elizaos';

// For PGLite (default)
process.env.SQLITE_DATA_DIR = './.elizadb'; // Optional, defaults to './sqlite'
```

### Retry Logic & Error Handling

The database system includes built-in retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter:

```typescript
protected async withRetry<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  let attempt = 0;
  let lastError: Error | null = null;

  while (attempt < this.maxRetries) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error as Error;
      const isRetryable = this.isRetryableError(error);

      if (!isRetryable) {
        break;
      }

      // Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter
      const delay = Math.min(
        this.baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random() * this.jitterMax,
        this.maxDelay
      );

      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      attempt++;
    }
  }

  throw lastError;
}
```

## Example Usage

Here are examples of common database operations:

### Store a Memory

```typescript
await runtime.createMemory(
  {
    entityId: message.entityId,
    agentId: runtime.agentId,
    content: { text: 'Important information to remember' },
    roomId: message.roomId,
    embedding: await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_EMBEDDING, {
      text: 'Important information to remember',
    }),
  },
  'facts'
);
```

### Search for Memories

```typescript
const embedding = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_EMBEDDING, {
  text: 'What did we discuss about databases?',
});

const relevantMemories = await runtime.searchMemories({
  tableName: 'messages',
  embedding,
  roomId: message.roomId,
  count: 5,
});
```

### Manage Entity Relationships

```typescript
// Create a relationship between entities
await runtime.createRelationship({
  sourceEntityId: userEntityId,
  targetEntityId: agentEntityId,
  tags: ['friend', 'frequent_interaction'],
  metadata: {
    interactions: 42,
    trust_level: 'high',
  },
});

// Retrieve relationships
const relationships = await runtime.getRelationships({
  entityId: userEntityId,
  tags: ['friend'],
});
```

## Database Schema

The schema is managed by Drizzle ORM and includes the following key tables:

### Core Tables

- **entities**: The fundamental objects in the system (users, agents, etc.)
- **components**: Modular data attached to entities (profiles, settings, etc.)
- **memories**: Conversation history and other remembered information
- **relationships**: Connections between entities
- **rooms**: Conversation channels
- **participants**: Entity participation in rooms
- **worlds**: Container for multiple rooms
- **tasks**: Scheduled or queued operations
- **cache**: Temporary key-value storage
- **agents**: Agent configuration and state

### Entity-Component System

ElizaOS uses an entity-component architecture where:

- Entities are the base objects (users, agents, etc.)
- Components are pieces of data attached to entities
- This allows for flexible data modeling and extension

For example, a user entity might have profile, preferences, and authentication components.

## Vector Search

Both adapters support vector-based semantic search with some differences:

- **PostgreSQL**: Uses pgvector extension for optimized vector operations
- **PGLite**: Implements vector search in JavaScript with an efficient algorithm

The embedding dimension is configurable based on the model used:

```typescript
await adapter.ensureEmbeddingDimension(1536); // For OpenAI embeddings
```

## FAQ

### How do I choose between PGLite and PostgreSQL?

- Use **PGLite** for:

  - Local development and testing
  - Single-user deployments
  - Situations where installing PostgreSQL is impractical

- Use **PostgreSQL** for:
  - Production deployments
  - Multi-user systems
  - High-volume data
  - When you need advanced scaling features

### How do I configure the database connection?

For PostgreSQL, set the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable:

```
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/elizaos
```

For PGLite, set the data directory (optional):

```
SQLITE_DATA_DIR=./my-data
```

### How can I inspect the database contents?

For PostgreSQL, use standard PostgreSQL tools like pgAdmin or psql.

For PGLite, the data is stored in the specified data directory as files. You can use tools like DB Browser for SQLite to inspect the SQLite files that PGLite generates.

### How do I migrate between different database adapters?

Currently, there's no built-in migration tool between adapters. For production systems, it's recommended to start with PostgreSQL if you anticipate needing its features.

### What about vector embedding dimension mismatches?

The system automatically handles embedding dimensions based on the model used. If you change embedding models, make sure to:

1. Set the correct dimension with `ensureEmbeddingDimension()`
2. Be aware that mixing different dimensions in the same database can cause issues

### How does the entity-component system work?

The entity-component system (ECS) provides a flexible way to model data:

- **Entities** are base objects with unique IDs
- **Components** are pieces of data attached to entities
- This allows for dynamic composition of objects without complex inheritance

For example, a user entity might have profile, preferences, and authentication components.

### How can I improve database performance?

- For **PostgreSQL**:

  - Ensure the pgvector extension is properly installed
  - Index frequently queried fields
  - Use connection pooling
  - Consider partitioning for large datasets

- For **PGLite**:
  - Keep database size reasonable (under 1GB)
  - Regularly clean up old memories
  - Limit the number of concurrent operations

### Will other database adapters be supported in the future?

Yes, future releases will add support for additional databases such as:

- MongoDB
- SQLite
- Supabase
- Qdrant
- SQL.js

The adapter interface is designed to be extensible to support a wide range of storage solutions.

# Entities

Entities in ElizaOS represent users, agents, or any participant that can interact within the system. They form the basis of the entity-component architecture, allowing for flexible data modeling and relationships across the platform.

![](/img/entities-component-architecture.svg)

## Entity Structure

An entity in ElizaOS has the following properties:

```typescript
interface Entity {
  /** Unique identifier, optional on creation */
  id?: UUID;

  /** Names of the entity */
  names: string[];

  /** Optional additional metadata */
  metadata?: { [key: string]: any };

  /** Agent ID this account is related to, for agents should be themselves */
  agentId: UUID;

  /** Optional array of components */
  components?: Component[];
}
```

| Property     | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Unique identifier for the entity (optional on creation)  |
| `names`      | Array of names the entity is known by                    |
| `metadata`   | Additional information about the entity                  |
| `agentId`    | ID of the agent related to this entity                   |
| `components` | Array of modular data components attached to this entity |

## Components

Components are modular pieces of data attached to entities with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Component {
  id: UUID;
  entityId: UUID;
  agentId: UUID;
  roomId: UUID;
  worldId: UUID;
  sourceEntityId: UUID;
  type: string;
  data: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

| Property         | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | Unique identifier for the component               |
| `entityId`       | ID of the entity this component belongs to        |
| `agentId`        | ID of the agent managing this component           |
| `roomId`         | ID of the room this component is associated with  |
| `worldId`        | ID of the world this component is associated with |
| `sourceEntityId` | ID of the entity that created this component      |
| `type`           | Type of component (e.g., "profile", "settings")   |
| `data`           | Additional data specific to this component type   |

## Entity Creation and Management

### Creating an Entity

```typescript
const entityId = await runtime.createEntity({
  names: ['John Doe', 'JohnD'],
  agentId: runtime.agentId,
  metadata: {
    discord: {
      username: 'john_doe',
      name: 'John Doe',
    },
  },
});
```

### Retrieving an Entity

```typescript
// Get an entity by ID
const entity = await runtime.getEntityById(entityId);

// Get all entities in a room
const entitiesInRoom = await runtime.getEntitiesForRoom(roomId, true); // true to include components
```

### Updating an Entity

```typescript
await runtime.updateEntity({
  id: entityId,
  names: [...entity.names, 'Johnny'],
  metadata: {
    ...entity.metadata,
    customProperty: 'value',
  },
});
```

## Component Management

Components allow for flexible data modeling by attaching different types of data to entities.

### Creating a Component

```typescript
await runtime.createComponent({
  id: componentId,
  entityId: entityId,
  agentId: runtime.agentId,
  roomId: roomId,
  worldId: worldId,
  sourceEntityId: creatorEntityId,
  type: 'profile',
  data: {
    bio: 'Software developer interested in AI',
    location: 'San Francisco',
    website: 'https://example.com',
  },
});
```

### Retrieving Components

```typescript
// Get a specific component type
const profileComponent = await runtime.getComponent(
  entityId,
  'profile',
  worldId, // optional filter by world
  sourceEntityId // optional filter by source
);

// Get all components for an entity
const allComponents = await runtime.getComponents(entityId, worldId, sourceEntityId);
```

### Updating Components

```typescript
await runtime.updateComponent({
  id: profileComponent.id,
  data: {
    ...profileComponent.data,
    bio: 'Updated bio information',
  },
});
```

### Deleting Components

```typescript
await runtime.deleteComponent(componentId);
```

## Entity Relationships

Entities can have relationships with other entities, stored in the database:

```typescript
// Create a relationship between entities
await runtime.createRelationship({
  sourceEntityId: entityId1,
  targetEntityId: entityId2,
  tags: ['friend', 'collaborator'],
  metadata: {
    interactions: 5,
    lastInteraction: Date.now(),
  },
});

// Get relationships for an entity
const relationships = await runtime.getRelationships({
  entityId: entityId1,
  tags: ['friend'], // optional filter by tags
});

// Get a specific relationship
const relationship = await runtime.getRelationship({
  sourceEntityId: entityId1,
  targetEntityId: entityId2,
});

// Update a relationship
await runtime.updateRelationship({
  ...relationship,
  metadata: {
    ...relationship.metadata,
    interactions: relationship.metadata.interactions + 1,
    lastInteraction: Date.now(),
  },
});
```

## Entity Resolution

ElizaOS includes a system for resolving entity references from messages and context. This is particularly useful for determining which entity is being referenced in a conversation.

```typescript
// Find an entity by name or reference
const entity = await findEntityByName(runtime, message, state);
```

The entity resolution system considers:

1. Exact matches by ID or username
2. Contextual matches from recent conversations
3. Relationship strength between entities
4. Role-based permissions in worlds

## Entity Details

To get formatted information about entities in a room:

```typescript
// Get detailed information about entities in a room
const entityDetails = await getEntityDetails({
  runtime,
  roomId,
});

// Format entities into a string representation
const formattedEntities = formatEntities({ entities: entitiesInRoom });
```

## Relationship with Rooms and Worlds

Entities participate in rooms and, by extension, in worlds:

```typescript
// Add an entity as a participant in a room
await runtime.addParticipant(entityId, roomId);

// Get all rooms where an entity is a participant
const entityRooms = await runtime.getRoomsForParticipant(entityId);

// Get all participants in a room
const participants = await runtime.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);
```

When an entity is a participant in a room that belongs to a world, the entity has an implicit relationship with that world.

## Creating Unique Entity IDs

For situations where you need to create deterministic, unique IDs for entity-agent pairs:

```typescript
const uniqueId = createUniqueUuid(runtime, baseUserId);
```

This ensures that each user-agent interaction has a consistent, unique identifier.

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful names**: Provide descriptive names in the `names` array to make entity identification easier
2. **Structure metadata carefully**: Organize metadata by source (e.g., `discord`, `telegram`) for clarity
3. **Component segregation**: Use components to separate different aspects of entity data rather than storing everything in metadata
4. **Permission checking**: Always verify permissions before accessing components created by other entities
5. **Relationship maintenance**: Update relationship metadata regularly to reflect recent interactions
6. **Entity resolution**: Use the entity resolution system to correctly identify entities in conversations
7. **Deterministic IDs**: Use `createUniqueUuid` for consistent entity identification across sessions

# 🧠 Evaluators

Evaluators are cognitive components in the ElizaOS framework that enable agents to process conversations, extract knowledge, and build understanding - similar to how humans form memories after interactions. They provide a structured way for agents to introspect, learn from interactions, and evolve over time.

## Understanding Evaluators

Evaluators are specialized functions that work with the [`AgentRuntime`](/api/classes/AgentRuntime) to analyze conversations after a response has been generated. Unlike actions that create responses, evaluators perform background cognitive tasks that enable numerous advanced capabilities:

- **Knowledge Building**: Automatically extract and store facts from conversations
- **Relationship Tracking**: Identify connections between entities
- **Conversation Quality**: Perform self-reflection on interaction quality
- **Goal Tracking**: Determine if conversation objectives are being met
- **Tone Analysis**: Evaluate emotional content and adjust future responses
- **User Profiling**: Build understanding of user preferences and needs over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Gather data on agent effectiveness and learn from interactions

### Core Structure

```typescript
interface Evaluator {
  name: string; // Unique identifier
  similes?: string[]; // Alternative names/triggers
  description: string; // Purpose explanation
  examples: EvaluationExample[]; // Sample usage patterns
  handler: Handler; // Implementation logic
  validate: Validator; // Execution criteria check
  alwaysRun?: boolean; // Run regardless of validation
}
```

### Evaluator Execution Flow

The agent runtime executes evaluators as part of its cognitive cycle:

1. Agent processes a message and generates a response
2. Runtime calls `evaluate()` after response generation
3. Each evaluator's `validate()` method determines if it should run
4. For each valid evaluator, the `handler()` function is executed
5. Results are stored in memory and inform future responses

---

## Fact Evaluator: Memory Formation System

The Fact Evaluator serves as the agent's "episodic memory formation" system - similar to how humans process conversations and form memories. Just as you might reflect after a conversation "Oh, I learned something new about Sarah today", the Fact Evaluator systematically processes conversations to build up the agent's understanding of the world and the people in it.

### How It Works

#### 1. Triggering (The "When to Reflect" System)

```typescript
validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise<boolean> => {
  const messageCount = await runtime.messageManager.countMemories(message.roomId);
  const reflectionCount = Math.ceil(runtime.getConversationLength() / 2);
  return messageCount % reflectionCount === 0;
};
```

Just like humans don't consciously analyze every single word in real-time, the Fact Evaluator runs periodically rather than after every message. It triggers a "reflection" phase every few messages to process what's been learned.

#### 2. Fact Extraction (The "What Did I Learn?" System)

The evaluator uses a template-based approach to extract three types of information:

- **Facts**: Unchanging truths about the world or people
  - "Bob lives in New York"
  - "Sarah has a degree in Computer Science"
- **Status**: Temporary or changeable states
  - "Bob is currently working on a new project"
  - "Sarah is visiting Paris this week"
- **Opinions**: Subjective views, feelings, or non-factual statements
  - "Bob thinks the project will be successful"
  - "Sarah loves French cuisine"

#### 3. Memory Deduplication (The "Is This New?" System)

```typescript
const filteredFacts = facts.filter((fact) => {
  return (
    !fact.already_known &&
    fact.type === 'fact' &&
    !fact.in_bio &&
    fact.claim &&
    fact.claim.trim() !== ''
  );
});
```

Just as humans don't need to consciously re-learn things they already know, the Fact Evaluator:

- Checks if information is already known
- Verifies if it's in the agent's existing knowledge (bio)
- Filters out duplicate or corrupted facts

#### 4. Memory Storage (The "Remember This" System)

```typescript
const factMemory = await factsManager.addEmbeddingToMemory({
  userId: agentId!,
  agentId,
  content: { text: fact },
  roomId,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
});
```

Facts are stored with embeddings to enable:

- Semantic search of related facts
- Context-aware recall
- Temporal tracking (when the fact was learned)

### Example Processing

Given this conversation:

```
User: "I just moved to Seattle last month!"
Agent: "How are you finding the weather there?"
User: "It's rainy, but I love my new job at the tech startup"
```

The Fact Evaluator might extract:

```json
[
  {
    "claim": "User moved to Seattle last month",
    "type": "fact",
    "in_bio": false,
    "already_known": false
  },
  {
    "claim": "User works at a tech startup",
    "type": "fact",
    "in_bio": false,
    "already_known": false
  },
  {
    "claim": "User enjoys their new job",
    "type": "opinion",
    "in_bio": false,
    "already_known": false
  }
]
```

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Episodic vs Semantic Memory**

   - Facts build up the agent's semantic memory (general knowledge)
   - The raw conversation remains in episodic memory (specific experiences)

2. **Temporal Awareness**

   - Facts are timestamped to track when they were learned
   - Status facts can be updated as they change

3. **Confidence and Verification**

   - Multiple mentions of a fact increase confidence
   - Contradictory facts can be flagged for verification

4. **Privacy and Relevance**
   - Only stores relevant, conversation-appropriate facts
   - Respects explicit and implicit privacy boundaries

---

## Reflection Evaluator: Self-Awareness System

The reflection evaluator extends beyond fact extraction to enable agents to develop a form of "self-awareness" about their conversational performance. It allows agents to:

1. Generate self-reflective thoughts about the conversation quality
2. Extract factual information from conversations (similar to the Fact Evaluator)
3. Identify and track relationships between entities

### How Reflections Work

When triggered, the reflection evaluator:

1. Analyzes recent conversations and existing knowledge
2. Generates structured reflection output with:
   - Self-reflective thoughts about conversation quality
   - New facts extracted from conversation
   - Identified relationships between entities
3. Stores this information in the agent's memory for future reference

### Example Reflection Output

```json
{
  "thought": "I'm engaging appropriately with John, maintaining a welcoming and professional tone. My questions are helping learn more about him as a new community member.",
  "facts": [
    {
      "claim": "John is new to the community",
      "type": "fact",
      "in_bio": false,
      "already_known": false
    },
    {
      "claim": "John found the community through a friend interested in AI",
      "type": "fact",
      "in_bio": false,
      "already_known": false
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "sourceEntityId": "sarah-agent",
      "targetEntityId": "user-123",
      "tags": ["group_interaction"]
    },
    {
      "sourceEntityId": "user-123",
      "targetEntityId": "sarah-agent",
      "tags": ["group_interaction"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation Details

The reflection evaluator uses a defined schema to ensure consistent output:

```typescript
const reflectionSchema = z.object({
  facts: z.array(
    z.object({
      claim: z.string(),
      type: z.string(),
      in_bio: z.boolean(),
      already_known: z.boolean(),
    })
  ),
  relationships: z.array(relationshipSchema),
});

const relationshipSchema = z.object({
  sourceEntityId: z.string(),
  targetEntityId: z.string(),
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
  metadata: z
    .object({
      interactions: z.number(),
    })
    .optional(),
});
```

### Validation Logic

The reflection evaluator includes validation logic that determines when reflection should occur:

```typescript
validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise<boolean> => {
  const lastMessageId = await runtime.getCache<string>(
    `${message.roomId}-reflection-last-processed`
  );
  const messages = await runtime.getMemories({
    tableName: 'messages',
    roomId: message.roomId,
    count: runtime.getConversationLength(),
  });

  if (lastMessageId) {
    const lastMessageIndex = messages.findIndex((msg) => msg.id === lastMessageId);
    if (lastMessageIndex !== -1) {
      messages.splice(0, lastMessageIndex + 1);
    }
  }

  const reflectionInterval = Math.ceil(runtime.getConversationLength() / 4);

  return messages.length > reflectionInterval;
};
```

This ensures reflections occur at appropriate intervals, typically after a set number of messages have been exchanged.

## Common Memory Formation Patterns

1. **Progressive Learning**

   ```typescript
   // First conversation
   "I live in Seattle" -> Stores as fact

   // Later conversation
   "I live in the Ballard neighborhood" -> Updates/enhances existing fact
   ```

2. **Fact Chaining**

   ```typescript
   // Original facts
   'Works at tech startup';
   'Startup is in Seattle';

   // Inference potential
   'Works in Seattle tech industry';
   ```

3. **Temporal Tracking**

   ```typescript
   // Status tracking
   t0: 'Looking for a job'(status);
   t1: 'Got a new job'(fact);
   t2: 'Been at job for 3 months'(status);
   ```

4. **Relationship Building**

   ```typescript
   // Initial relationship
   {
     "sourceEntityId": "user-123",
     "targetEntityId": "sarah-agent",
     "tags": ["new_interaction"]
   }

   // Evolving relationship
   {
     "sourceEntityId": "user-123",
     "targetEntityId": "sarah-agent",
     "tags": ["frequent_interaction", "positive_sentiment"],
     "metadata": { "interactions": 15 }
   }
   ```

## Integration with Other Systems

Evaluators work alongside other components:

- **Goal Evaluator**: Facts and reflections may influence goal progress
- **Trust Evaluator**: Fact consistency affects trust scoring
- **Memory Manager**: Facts enhance context for future conversations
- **Providers**: Facts inform response generation

---

## Creating Custom Evaluators

You can create your own evaluators by implementing the `Evaluator` interface:

```typescript
const customEvaluator: Evaluator = {
  name: 'CUSTOM_EVALUATOR',
  similes: ['ANALYZE', 'ASSESS'],
  description: 'Performs custom analysis on conversations',

  validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory): Promise<boolean> => {
    // Your validation logic here
    return true;
  },

  handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state?: State) => {
    // Your evaluation logic here

    // Example of storing evaluation results
    await runtime.addEmbeddingToMemory({
      entityId: runtime.agentId,
      content: { text: 'Evaluation result' },
      roomId: message.roomId,
      createdAt: Date.now(),
    });

    return { result: 'evaluation complete' };
  },

  examples: [
    {
      prompt: `Example context`,
      messages: [
        { name: 'User', content: { text: 'Example message' } },
        { name: 'Agent', content: { text: 'Example response' } },
      ],
      outcome: `{ "result": "example outcome" }`,
    },
  ],
};
```

### Registering Custom Evaluators

Custom evaluators can be registered with the agent runtime:

```typescript
// In your plugin's initialization
export default {
  name: 'custom-evaluator-plugin',
  description: 'Adds custom evaluation capabilities',

  init: async (config: any, runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
    // Register your custom evaluator
    runtime.registerEvaluator(customEvaluator);
  },

  // Include the evaluator in the plugin exports
  evaluators: [customEvaluator],
};
```

## Best Practices for Memory Formation

1. **Validate Facts**

   - Cross-reference with existing knowledge
   - Consider source reliability
   - Track fact confidence levels

2. **Manage Memory Growth**

   - Prioritize important facts
   - Consolidate related facts
   - Archive outdated status facts

3. **Handle Contradictions**

   - Flag conflicting facts
   - Maintain fact history
   - Update based on newest information

4. **Respect Privacy**

   - Filter sensitive information
   - Consider contextual appropriateness
   - Follow data retention policies

5. **Balance Reflection Frequency**
   - Too frequent: Computational overhead
   - Too infrequent: Missing important information
   - Adapt based on conversation complexity and pace

---

## FAQ

### What's the difference between actions and evaluators?

Actions are triggered during response generation and create visible outputs, while evaluators run after responses and perform background cognitive tasks without direct user visibility.

### When should I use the Fact Evaluator vs. the Reflection Evaluator?

Use the Fact Evaluator when you only need to extract and store factual information. Use the Reflection Evaluator when you need both fact extraction and relationship tracking, along with self-reflective assessment.

### How often do evaluators run?

By default, evaluators run at intervals based on conversation length, typically after every few messages, to avoid unnecessary processing while still capturing important information.

### Can evaluators affect future responses?

Yes! Facts and relationships stored by evaluators become part of the agent's memory and context, influencing future responses through the retrieval-augmented generation system.

### How do I debug evaluator issues?

Use the logger to inspect evaluator execution and output. The most common issues involve entity resolution failures or schema validation errors.

### Can evaluators work across different platforms?

Yes, evaluators are platform-agnostic and work the same way regardless of whether your agent is deployed on Discord, Twitter, Telegram, or web interfaces.

# Knowledge Management

## Overview

The Knowledge Management system in ElizaOS is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature that enables agents to process, store, and retrieve information from various sources. This allows agents to provide contextually relevant responses by leveraging stored knowledge during conversations.

## Adding Knowledge to Agents

ElizaOS provides multiple ways to add knowledge to your agents, both during initialization and at runtime.

### Adding Knowledge During Runtime Creation

#### 1. Via Character Definition

The simplest approach is to define knowledge directly in your character configuration:

```typescript
const character: Character = {
  name: 'My Agent',
  // Other character properties...
  knowledge: [
    // Direct string knowledge
    'Important fact: ElizaOS supports multiple knowledge formats',

    // File references
    { path: 'knowledge/documentation.md', shared: false },

    // Directory references
    { directory: 'knowledge/guides', shared: true },
  ],
};
```

The knowledge array supports three formats:

- String literals for direct knowledge
- File objects pointing to specific files
- Directory objects for entire folders of content

#### 2. Programmatically Before Runtime Initialization

You can dynamically load knowledge before creating your runtime:

```typescript
// Load knowledge from files or other sources
const knowledge = [];

// Example: Recursively load documentation files
function loadDocumentation(directoryPath) {
  const files = getFilesRecursively(directoryPath, ['.md']);
  return files.map((filePath) => {
    const relativePath = path.relative(basePath, filePath);
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
    return `Path: ${relativePath}\n\n${content}`;
  });
}

// Load documentation
const docKnowledge = loadDocumentation('./docs');
knowledge.push(...docKnowledge);

// Then include in your character definition
const character: Character = {
  // Other character properties...
  knowledge: knowledge,
};
```

### Adding Knowledge After Runtime Creation

#### 1. Using the `addKnowledge` Method

Add knowledge programmatically after the runtime is initialized:

```typescript
// Import needed utilities
import { createUniqueUuid } from '@elizaos/core';

// Create a knowledge item
const knowledgeItem = {
  id: createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'unique-knowledge-identifier'),
  content: {
    text: 'Important information the agent should know...',
  },
};

// Add to runtime with default chunking settings
await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem);

// Or with custom chunking settings
await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem, {
  targetTokens: 1500, // Target chunk size (default: 3000)
  overlap: 100, // Overlap between chunks (default: 200)
  modelContextSize: 8192, // Context size of your model (default: 4096)
});
```

#### 2. Processing Files at Runtime

You can dynamically process files at runtime:

```typescript
// For PDF files, use the PDF service
const pdfService = runtime.getService<IPdfService>('pdf');
if (pdfService) {
  const pdfBuffer = fs.readFileSync('./knowledge/document.pdf');
  const textContent = await pdfService.convertPdfToText(pdfBuffer);

  const knowledgeItem = {
    id: createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'document.pdf'),
    content: { text: textContent },
  };

  await runtime.addKnowledge(knowledgeItem);
}
```

## Directory Structure

ElizaOS expects knowledge files to be organized in the following structure:

```
knowledge/          # Root knowledge directory
├── shared/         # Shared knowledge accessible to all agents
└── {agent-name}/   # Agent-specific knowledge directories
```

## Supported File Types

- PDF files (`.pdf`)
- Markdown files (`.md`)
- Text files (`.txt`)

## Knowledge Modes

ElizaOS supports two knowledge modes:

### Classic Mode (Default)

- Direct string knowledge added to character's context
- No chunking or semantic search
- Enabled by default (`settings.ragKnowledge: false`)
- Only processes string knowledge entries
- Simpler but less sophisticated

### RAG Mode

- Advanced knowledge processing with semantic search
- Chunks content and uses embeddings
- Must be explicitly enabled (`settings.ragKnowledge: true`)
- Supports three knowledge types:
  1. Direct string knowledge
  2. Single file references: `{ "path": "path/to/file.md", "shared": false }`
  3. Directory references: `{ "directory": "knowledge/dir", "shared": false }`
- Supported file types: .md, .txt, .pdf
- Optional `shared` flag for knowledge reuse across characters

To enable RAG mode, add this to your character settings:

```typescript
const character: Character = {
  // Other character properties...
  settings: {
    ragKnowledge: true,
  },
};
```

## How Knowledge Processing Works

### Document Processing Flow

The RAG system processes documents through several stages:

1. **Directory Processing**

   - The system scans configured directories in `knowledge/`
   - Files are processed based on their shared/private status and file type

2. **File Processing Pipeline**

   - **Preprocessing**: Reading, cleaning, and normalizing text
   - **Document-level Processing**: Generating embeddings for the entire document
   - **Chunk Processing**: Splitting content into manageable chunks and generating embeddings for each

3. **Retrieval Process**
   - When a user message is received, its embedding is generated
   - This embedding is compared to stored knowledge embeddings
   - The most semantically similar chunks are retrieved
   - Retrieved knowledge is incorporated into the agent's context

This multi-level approach enables:

- Broad document-level semantic search
- Fine-grained chunk-level retrieval for specific information
- Efficient parallel processing of large documents
- Maintenance of document context through metadata linking

- **Chunk Overlap**: 20 tokens (default, configurable)
- **Processing Batch Size**: 10 chunks processed concurrently
- **Default Similarity Threshold**: 0.85 for retrieval
- **Default Match Count**: 5 results returned

## Best Practices for Knowledge Management

### Content Organization

1. **Document Structure**

   - Use clear section headings and hierarchical organization
   - Break large documents into logical smaller files
   - Include metadata and context in markdown files
   - Structure information from general to specific

2. **File Management**

   - Use descriptive filenames that reflect content
   - Group related files in subdirectories
   - Keep paths short and meaningful
   - Avoid special characters in filenames

3. **Knowledge Optimization**
   - Keep individual documents focused on specific topics
   - For very detailed information, use smaller chunks (200-300 tokens) by setting `targetTokens`
   - Balance the total number of knowledge items for performance
   - Prefer markdown (.md) files for best processing results

### Processing Large Knowledge Bases

When adding many knowledge items at once, consider implementing a semaphore pattern:

```typescript
import { Semaphore } from '@elizaos/core';

// Create semaphore to limit concurrent processing
const semaphore = new Semaphore(10);

// Process items with controlled concurrency
await Promise.all(
  items.map(async (item) => {
    await semaphore.acquire();
    try {
      await runtime.addKnowledge(item);
    } finally {
      semaphore.release();
    }
  })
);
```

### Knowledge ID Management

When adding knowledge programmatically, use consistent ID generation:

```typescript
import { createUniqueUuid } from '@elizaos/core';
const knowledgeId = createUniqueUuid(runtime, 'my-content');
```

This ensures deterministic IDs that remain stable across sessions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Knowledge Not Being Retrieved**:

   - Verify the file is in a supported format (PDF, MD, TXT)
   - Check if embeddings were properly generated
   - Ensure similarity threshold isn't too high (default: 0.85)
   - Test retrieval with more specific queries
   - Verify RAG mode is enabled if using file/directory references

2. **Poor Quality Retrievals**:

   - Break down large documents into smaller, focused files
   - Ensure document content is clear and well-structured
   - Review the chunking size and overlap settings
   - Check if the query contains too many common words

3. **Performance Issues**:

   - Monitor the total number of knowledge items
   - Consider reducing the match count for faster retrieval
   - Check embedding processing time for large documents
   - Use shared knowledge efficiently across agents

4. **File Processing Errors**:
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check if paths are correctly structured
   - Ensure PDF files are readable and not password-protected
   - Validate that text encoding is UTF-8

## Technical Implementation Details

### Knowledge ID Relationships

The RAG system uses a hierarchical ID structure to maintain relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Document {
        +UUID id
        +String filePath
        +String fileType
        +Boolean isShared
        +Float32Array embedding
        +String content
    }

    class Fragment {
        +UUID id
        +UUID originalId
        +Number chunkIndex
        +String content
        +Float32Array embedding
        +String originalPath
    }

    Document "1" --> "*" Fragment : generates
```

#### ID Generation and Linking

Documents IDs are generated using `createUniqueUuid(runtime, path, isShared)`, making them deterministic. Fragment IDs follow the format `${documentId}-chunk-${index}` to maintain the relationship to their source document.

## API Reference

### Key Methods

#### `runtime.addKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?): Promise<void>`

Adds new knowledge to the agent.

- Parameters:
  - `item`: A knowledge item containing:
    - `id`: UUID
    - `content`: Object with `text` property
  - `options`: Optional processing configuration:
    - `targetTokens`: Number (default: 3000)
    - `overlap`: Number (default: 200)
    - `modelContextSize`: Number (default: 4096)

#### `runtime.getKnowledge(message: Memory): Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>`

Retrieves knowledge based on a message's content.

- Parameters:
  - `message`: Memory object containing user message
- Returns: Array of matching KnowledgeItem objects

### Knowledge Item Definition

```typescript
interface KnowledgeItem {
  id: UUID;
  content: {
    text: string;
    // Optional additional metadata
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**:

   - Use the `shared` flag appropriately to control document access
   - Keep sensitive information in agent-specific directories
   - Regularly audit knowledge access patterns

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Do not store sensitive personal information in knowledge files
   - Review documents for potentially sensitive content before adding
   - Implement appropriate backup and recovery procedures

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:

   - Monitor knowledge base size and performance
   - Plan for regular maintenance and cleanup
   - Consider implementing document versioning

2. **Integration**:
   - Document integration points with other systems
   - Plan for potential future file format support
   - Consider implementing knowledge base analytics

### How ElizaOS Works

When a user message is received:

1. **Service Reception**: Platform service (Discord, Telegram, etc.) receives the message
2. **Runtime Processing**: Agent runtime coordinates the response generation
3. **Context Building**: Providers supply relevant context (time, recent messages, knowledge)
4. **Action Selection**: The agent evaluates and selects appropriate actions
5. **Response Generation**: The chosen action generates a response
6. **Learning & Reflection**: Evaluators analyze the conversation for insights and learning
7. **Memory Storage**: New information is stored in the database
8. **Response Delivery**: The response is sent back through the service

This creates a continuous cycle of interaction, reflection, and improvement that allows agents to maintain consistent personalities while adapting to new information.

## Key Concepts

### Action-Provider-Evaluator Cycle

The core of the ElizaOS system operates as a continuous cycle:

1. **Providers** gather context before response generation
2. **Actions** determine what the agent can do and are executed to generate responses
3. **Evaluators** analyze conversations after responses to extract insights
4. These insights become part of the agent's memory
5. Future **Providers** access this memory to inform new responses

This creates a virtuous cycle where agents continuously learn and improve from interactions.

### Entity-Component Architecture

ElizaOS uses an entity-component architecture for flexible data modeling:

- **Entities** are base objects with unique IDs (users, agents, etc.)
- **Components** are pieces of data attached to entities (profiles, settings, etc.)
- This approach allows for dynamic composition without complex inheritance hierarchies

### Memory System

The memory system in ElizaOS provides:

- **Vector-based semantic search** for finding relevant memories
- **Multi-level memory types** (messages, facts, knowledge)
- **Temporal awareness** through timestamped memories
- **Cross-platform continuity** while maintaining appropriate context boundaries

## Getting Started

If you're new to ElizaOS, we recommend this learning path:

1. Start with this overview to understand the system architecture
2. Explore the [Agent Runtime](/docs/core/agents) to understand the core system
3. Learn about [Projects](/docs/core/project) to set up your development environment
4. Understand how [Actions](/docs/core/actions) and [Providers](/docs/core/providers) work together
5. Explore [Services](/docs/core/services) to connect with external platforms
6. Dive into [Plugins](/docs/core/plugins) to extend functionality

## FAQ

**What's the difference between Actions, Evaluators, and Providers?**

Actions define what an agent can do and are executed during response generation. Evaluators analyze conversations after they happen to extract insights and improve future responses. Providers supply contextual information before the agent decides how to respond.

**How does ElizaOS handle cross-platform conversation context?**

ElizaOS maintains separate conversation contexts for different platforms by default, but shares entity relationships and learned facts across platforms. This ensures agents maintain a consistent understanding of users while respecting platform-specific conversation boundaries.

**How does the memory system work?**

Memory is organized into different types (messages, facts, knowledge) and stored with vector embeddings for semantic search. This allows agents to retrieve relevant memories based on context rather than just recency, creating more natural conversations.

**What's the relationship between Worlds, Rooms, and Entities?**

Worlds are container spaces (like a Discord server) that can have multiple Rooms (channels, DMs). Entities (users, agents) participate in Rooms within Worlds. This hierarchical structure mirrors real-world platforms while providing a consistent abstraction.

**How extensible is ElizaOS?**

ElizaOS is highly extensible through its plugin system. You can create custom actions, providers, evaluators, services, and more to extend functionality. The architecture is designed to be modular and composable at every level.

# 🔌 Providers

[Providers](/packages/core/src/providers.ts) are the sources of information for the agent. They provide data or state while acting as the agent's "senses", injecting real-time information into the agent's context. They serve as the eyes, ears, and other sensory inputs that allow the agent to perceive and interact with its environment, like a bridge between the agent and various external systems such as market data, wallet information, sentiment analysis, and temporal context. Anything that the agent knows is either coming from like the built-in context or from a provider. For more info, see the [providers API page](/api/interfaces/provider).

Here's an example of how providers work within ElizaOS:

- A news provider could fetch and format news.
- A computer terminal provider in a game could feed the agent information when the player is near a terminal.
- A wallet provider can provide the agent with the current assets in a wallet.
- A time provider injects the current date and time into the context.

---

## Overview

A provider's primary purpose is to supply dynamic contextual information that integrates with the agent's runtime. They format information for conversation templates and maintain consistent data access. For example:

- **Function:** Providers run during or before an action is executed.
- **Purpose:** They allow for fetching information from other APIs or services to provide different context or ways for an action to be performed.
- **Example:** Before a "Mars rover action" is executed, a provider could fetch information from another API. This fetched information can then be used to enrich the context of the Mars rover action.

The provider interface is defined in [types.ts](/packages/core/src/types.ts):

```typescript
interface Provider {
  /** Provider name */
  name: string;

  /** Description of the provider */
  description?: string;

  /** Whether the provider is dynamic */
  dynamic?: boolean;

  /** Position of the provider in the provider list, positive or negative */
  position?: number;

  /**
   * Whether the provider is private
   *
   * Private providers are not displayed in the regular provider list, they have to be called explicitly
   */
  private?: boolean;

  /** Data retrieval function */
  get: (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) => Promise<ProviderResult>;
}
```

The `get` function takes:

- `runtime`: The agent instance calling the provider
- `message`: The last message received
- `state`: Current conversation state

It returns a `ProviderResult` object that contains:

```typescript
interface ProviderResult {
  values?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  data?: {
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  text?: string;
}
```

- `values`: Key-value pairs to be merged into the agent's state values
- `data`: Additional structured data that can be used by the agent but not directly included in the context
- `text`: String that gets injected into the agent's context

---

## Provider Types and Properties

Providers come with several properties that control how and when they are used:

### Dynamic Providers

Dynamic providers are not automatically included in the context. They must be explicitly requested either in the filter list or include list when composing state.

```typescript
const dynamicProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'dynamicExample',
  description: 'A dynamic provider example',
  dynamic: true,
  get: async (runtime, message, state) => {
    // ...implementation
    return {
      text: 'Dynamic information fetched on demand',
      values: {
        /* key-value pairs */
      },
    };
  },
};
```

### Private Providers

Private providers are not included in the regular provider list and must be explicitly included in the include list when composing state.

```typescript
const privateProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'privateExample',
  description: 'A private provider example',
  private: true,
  get: async (runtime, message, state) => {
    // ...implementation
    return {
      text: 'Private information only available when explicitly requested',
      values: {
        /* key-value pairs */
      },
    };
  },
};
```

### Provider Positioning

The `position` property determines the order in which providers are processed. Lower numbers are processed first.

```typescript
const earlyProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'earlyExample',
  description: 'Runs early in the provider chain',
  position: -100,
  get: async (runtime, message, state) => {
    // ...implementation
    return {
      text: 'Early information',
      values: {
        /* key-value pairs */
      },
    };
  },
};

const lateProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'lateExample',
  description: 'Runs late in the provider chain',
  position: 100,
  get: async (runtime, message, state) => {
    // ...implementation
    return {
      text: 'Late information that might depend on earlier providers',
      values: {
        /* key-value pairs */
      },
    };
  },
};
```

---

## State Composition with Providers

The runtime composes state by gathering data from enabled providers. When calling `composeState`, you can control which providers are used:

```typescript
// Get state with all non-private, non-dynamic providers
const state = await runtime.composeState(message);

// Get state with specific providers only
const filteredState = await runtime.composeState(
  message,
  ['timeProvider', 'factsProvider'], // Only include these providers
  null
);

// Include private or dynamic providers
const enhancedState = await runtime.composeState(
  message,
  null,
  ['privateExample', 'dynamicExample'] // Include these private/dynamic providers
);
```

The system caches provider results to optimize performance. When a provider is called multiple times with the same message, the cached result is used unless you explicitly request a new evaluation.

---

### Time Provider Example

```typescript
const timeProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'time',
  description: 'Provides the current date and time',
  position: -10, // Run early to ensure time is available for other providers
  get: async (_runtime: IAgentRuntime, _message: Memory) => {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const options = {
      timeZone: 'UTC',
      dateStyle: 'full' as const,
      timeStyle: 'long' as const,
    };
    const humanReadable = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options).format(currentDate);

    return {
      text: `The current date and time is ${humanReadable}. Please use this as your reference for any time-based operations or responses.`,
      values: {
        currentDate: currentDate.toISOString(),
        humanReadableDate: humanReadable,
      },
    };
  },
};
```

### Dynamic Provider Example

```typescript
const weatherProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'weather',
  description: 'Provides weather information for a location',
  dynamic: true, // Only used when explicitly requested
  get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory, state: State) => {
    // Extract location from state if available
    const location = state?.values?.location || 'San Francisco';

    try {
      // Fetch weather data from an API
      const weatherData = await fetchWeatherData(location);

      return {
        text: `The current weather in ${location} is ${weatherData.description} with a temperature of ${weatherData.temperature}°C.`,
        values: {
          weather: {
            location,
            temperature: weatherData.temperature,
            description: weatherData.description,
            humidity: weatherData.humidity,
          },
        },
        data: {
          // Additional detailed data that doesn't go into the context
          weatherDetails: weatherData,
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors gracefully
      return {
        text: `I couldn't retrieve weather information for ${location} at this time.`,
        values: {
          weather: { error: true },
        },
      };
    }
  },
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Optimize for Efficiency

- Return both structured data (`values`) and formatted text (`text`)
- Use caching for expensive operations
- Include a clear provider name and description

```typescript
const efficientProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'efficientExample',
  description: 'Efficiently provides cached data',
  get: async (runtime, message) => {
    // Check for cached data
    const cacheKey = `data:${message.roomId}`;
    const cachedData = await runtime.getCache(cacheKey);

    if (cachedData) {
      return cachedData;
    }

    // Fetch fresh data if not cached
    const result = {
      text: 'Freshly generated information',
      values: {
        /* key-value pairs */
      },
      data: {
        /* structured data */
      },
    };

    // Cache the result with appropriate TTL
    await runtime.setCache(cacheKey, result, { expires: 30 * 60 * 1000 }); // 30 minutes

    return result;
  },
};
```

### 2. Handle Errors Gracefully

Always handle errors without throwing exceptions that would interrupt the agent's processing:

```typescript
try {
  // Risky operation
} catch (error) {
  return {
    text: "I couldn't retrieve that information right now.",
    values: { error: true },
  };
}
```

### 3. Use Position for Optimal Order

Position providers according to their dependencies:

- Negative positions: Fundamental information providers (time, location)
- Zero (default): Standard information providers
- Positive positions: Providers that depend on other information

### 4. Structure Return Values Consistently

Maintain a consistent structure in your provider's return values to make data easier to use across the system.

---

## FAQ

### What's the difference between values, data, and text?

- `values`: These are merged into the agent state and can be accessed by other providers
- `data`: Structured data stored in state.data.providers but not directly exposed to the agent
- `text`: Formatted text that's directly injected into the agent's context

### When should I use a dynamic provider?

Use dynamic providers when the information is expensive to compute, only relevant in specific situations, or requires explicit triggering rather than being included in every context.

### How do I explicitly include a private provider?

Private providers must be included in the `includeList` parameter when calling `composeState`:

```typescript
const state = await runtime.composeState(message, null, ['privateProviderName']);
```

### Can providers access service functionality?

Yes, providers can use services through the runtime. For example, a wallet provider might use a blockchain service to fetch data:

```typescript
const walletProvider: Provider = {
  name: 'wallet',
  get: async (runtime, message) => {
    const solanaService = runtime.getService('solana');
    if (!solanaService) {
      return { text: '' };
    }

    const walletData = await solanaService.getCachedData();
    // Process and return wallet data
  },
};
```

### How should providers handle failures?

Providers should handle failures gracefully and return valid ProviderResult objects with appropriate error information. Never throw errors that would break the agent's context composition.

### Can providers maintain state between calls?

While providers can maintain internal state (e.g., through closures), it's better to use the runtime's cache system for persistence:

```typescript
// Store data
await runtime.setCache('myProvider:someKey', dataToStore);

// Retrieve data later
const storedData = await runtime.getCache('myProvider:someKey');
```

# Rooms

Rooms in ElizaOS represent individual interaction spaces within a world. A room can be a conversation, a channel, a thread, or any other defined space where entities can exchange messages and interact. Rooms are typically contained within a world, though they can also exist independently.

![](/img/elizaos-rooms-simplified.svg)

## Room Structure

A room in ElizaOS has the following properties:

```typescript
type Room = {
  id: UUID;
  name?: string;
  agentId?: UUID;
  source: string;
  type: ChannelType;
  channelId?: string;
  serverId?: string;
  worldId?: UUID;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

| Property    | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | Unique identifier for the room                                   |
| `name`      | Optional display name for the room                               |
| `agentId`   | Optional ID of the agent associated with this room               |
| `source`    | The platform or origin of the room (e.g., 'discord', 'telegram') |
| `type`      | Type of room (DM, GROUP, THREAD, etc.)                           |
| `channelId` | External system channel identifier                               |
| `serverId`  | External system server identifier                                |
| `worldId`   | Optional ID of the parent world                                  |
| `metadata`  | Additional room configuration data                               |

## Room Types

ElizaOS supports several room types, defined in the `ChannelType` enum:

| Type          | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SELF`        | Messages to self                          |
| `DM`          | Direct messages between two participants  |
| `GROUP`       | Group messages with multiple participants |
| `VOICE_DM`    | Voice direct messages                     |
| `VOICE_GROUP` | Voice channels with multiple participants |
| `FEED`        | Social media feed                         |
| `THREAD`      | Threaded conversation                     |
| `WORLD`       | World channel                             |
| `FORUM`       | Forum discussion                          |
| `API`         | Legacy type - Use DM or GROUP instead     |

## Room Creation and Management

### Creating a Room

You can create a new room using the AgentRuntime:

```typescript
const roomId = await runtime.createRoom({
  name: 'general-chat',
  source: 'discord',
  type: ChannelType.GROUP,
  channelId: 'external-channel-id',
  serverId: 'external-server-id',
  worldId: parentWorldId,
});
```

### Ensuring a Room Exists

To create a room if it doesn't already exist:

```typescript
await runtime.ensureRoomExists({
  id: roomId,
  name: 'general-chat',
  source: 'discord',
  type: ChannelType.GROUP,
  channelId: 'external-channel-id',
  serverId: 'external-server-id',
  worldId: parentWorldId,
});
```

### Retrieving Room Information

```typescript
// Get a specific room
const room = await runtime.getRoom(roomId);

// Get all rooms in a world
const worldRooms = await runtime.getRooms(worldId);
```

### Updating Room Properties

```typescript
await runtime.updateRoom({
  id: roomId,
  name: 'renamed-channel',
  metadata: {
    ...room.metadata,
    customProperty: 'value',
  },
});
```

### Deleting a Room

```typescript
await runtime.deleteRoom(roomId);
```

## Participants in Rooms

Rooms can have multiple participants (entities) that can exchange messages.

### Managing Room Participants

```typescript
// Add a participant to a room
await runtime.addParticipant(entityId, roomId);

// Remove a participant from a room
await runtime.removeParticipant(entityId, roomId);

// Get all participants in a room
const participants = await runtime.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);

// Get all rooms where an entity is a participant
const entityRooms = await runtime.getRoomsForParticipant(entityId);
```

### Participant States

Participants can have different states in a room:

```typescript
// Get a participant's state in a room
const state = await runtime.getParticipantUserState(roomId, entityId);
// Returns: 'FOLLOWED', 'MUTED', or null

// Set a participant's state in a room
await runtime.setParticipantUserState(roomId, entityId, 'FOLLOWED');
```

The participant states are:

| State      | Description                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FOLLOWED` | The agent actively follows the conversation and responds without being directly mentioned |
| `MUTED`    | The agent ignores messages in this room                                                   |
| `null`     | Default state - the agent responds only when directly mentioned                           |

## Following and Unfollowing Rooms

ElizaOS allows agents to "follow" rooms to actively participate in conversations without being explicitly mentioned. This functionality is managed through the `FOLLOW_ROOM` and `UNFOLLOW_ROOM` actions.

```typescript
// Follow a room (typically triggered by an action)
await runtime.setParticipantUserState(roomId, runtime.agentId, 'FOLLOWED');

// Unfollow a room
await runtime.setParticipantUserState(roomId, runtime.agentId, null);
```

## Memory and Messages in Rooms

Rooms store messages as memories in the database:

```typescript
// Create a new message in a room
const messageId = await runtime.createMemory(
  {
    entityId: senderEntityId,
    agentId: runtime.agentId,
    roomId: roomId,
    content: {
      text: 'Hello, world!',
      source: 'discord',
    },
    metadata: {
      type: 'message',
    },
  },
  'messages'
);

// Retrieve recent messages from a room
const messages = await runtime.getMemories({
  roomId: roomId,
  count: 10,
  unique: true,
});
```

## Events Related to Rooms

ElizaOS emits events related to room activities:

| Event              | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ROOM_JOINED`      | Emitted when an entity joins a room          |
| `ROOM_LEFT`        | Emitted when an entity leaves a room         |
| `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` | Emitted when a message is received in a room |
| `MESSAGE_SENT`     | Emitted when a message is sent to a room     |

### Handling Room Events

```typescript
// Register event handlers in your plugin
const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-room-plugin',
  description: 'Handles room events',

  events: {
    [EventTypes.ROOM_JOINED]: [
      async (payload) => {
        const { runtime, entityId, roomId } = payload;
        console.log(`Entity ${entityId} joined room ${roomId}`);
      },
    ],

    [EventTypes.MESSAGE_RECEIVED]: [
      async (payload: MessagePayload) => {
        const { runtime, message } = payload;
        console.log(`Message received in room ${message.roomId}`);
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Room Connection with External Systems

When integrating with external platforms, rooms are typically mapped to channels, conversations, or other interaction spaces:

```typescript
// Ensure the connection exists for a room from an external system
await runtime.ensureConnection({
  entityId: userEntityId,
  roomId: roomId,
  userName: 'username',
  name: 'display-name',
  source: 'discord',
  channelId: 'external-channel-id',
  serverId: 'external-server-id',
  type: ChannelType.GROUP,
  worldId: parentWorldId,
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate room types**: Select the most appropriate room type for each interaction context
2. **Follow relationship order**: Create worlds before creating rooms, as rooms often have a parent world
3. **Use ensureRoomExists**: Use this method to avoid duplicate rooms when syncing with external systems
4. **Clean up rooms**: Delete rooms when they're no longer needed to prevent database bloat
5. **Room metadata**: Use metadata for room-specific configuration that doesn't fit into the standard properties
6. **Follow state management**: Implement clear rules for when agents should follow or unfollow rooms
7. **Handle participants carefully**: Ensure that participant management aligns with external platform behavior

## System Overview

Services serve as bridges between Eliza agents and various platforms, providing core capabilities:

1. **Message Processing**

   - Platform-specific message formatting and delivery
   - Media handling and attachments via [`Memory`](/api/interfaces/Memory) objects
   - Reply threading and context management
   - Support for different content types

2. **State & Memory Management**

   - Each service maintains independent state to prevent cross-platform contamination
   - Integrates with runtime memory managers for different types of content:
   - Messages processed by one service don't automatically appear in other services' contexts
   - [`State`](/api/interfaces/State) persists across agent restarts through the database adapter

3. **Platform Integration**
   - Authentication and API compliance
   - Event processing and webhooks
   - Rate limiting and cache management
   - Platform-specific feature support

## Service Configuration

Services are configured through the [`Character`](/api/type-aliases/Character) configuration's `settings` property:

```typescript
export type Character = {
  // ... other properties ...
  settings?: {
    discord?: {
      shouldIgnoreBotMessages?: boolean;
      shouldIgnoreDirectMessages?: boolean;
      shouldRespondOnlyToMentions?: boolean;
      messageSimilarityThreshold?: number;
      isPartOfTeam?: boolean;
      teamAgentIds?: string[];
      teamLeaderId?: string;
      teamMemberInterestKeywords?: string[];
      allowedChannelIds?: string[];
      autoPost?: {
        enabled?: boolean;
        monitorTime?: number;
        inactivityThreshold?: number;
        mainChannelId?: string;
        announcementChannelIds?: string[];
        minTimeBetweenPosts?: number;
      };
    };
    telegram?: {
      shouldIgnoreBotMessages?: boolean;
      shouldIgnoreDirectMessages?: boolean;
      shouldRespondOnlyToMentions?: boolean;
      shouldOnlyJoinInAllowedGroups?: boolean;
      allowedGroupIds?: string[];
      messageSimilarityThreshold?: number;
      // ... other telegram-specific settings
    };
    slack?: {
      shouldIgnoreBotMessages?: boolean;
      shouldIgnoreDirectMessages?: boolean;
    };
    // ... other service configs
  };
};
```

## Service Implementation

Each service manages its own:

- Platform-specific message formatting and delivery
- Event processing and webhooks
- Authentication and API integration
- Message queueing and rate limiting
- Media handling and attachments
- State management and persistence

Example of a basic service implementation:

```typescript
import { Service, IAgentRuntime } from '@elizaos/core';

export class CustomService extends Service {
  static serviceType = 'custom';
  capabilityDescription = 'The agent is able to interact with the custom platform';

  constructor(protected runtime: IAgentRuntime) {
    super();
    // Initialize platform connection
    // Set up event handlers
    // Configure message processing
  }

  static async start(runtime: IAgentRuntime): Promise<CustomService> {
    const service = new CustomService(runtime);
    // Additional initialization if needed
    return service;
  }

  async stop(): Promise<void> {
    // Cleanup resources
    // Close connections
  }
}
```

### Runtime Integration

Services interact with the agent runtime through the [`IAgentRuntime`](api/interfaces/IAgentRuntime/) interface, which provides:

- Memory managers for different types of data storage
- Service access for capabilities like transcription or image generation
- State management and composition
- Message processing and action handling

### Memory System Integration

Services use the runtime's memory managers to persist conversation data (source: [`memory.ts`](/api/interfaces/Memory)).

- `messageManager` Chat messages
- `documentsManager` File attachments
- `descriptionManager` Media descriptions

<details>
<summary>See example</summary>
```typescript
// Store a new message
await runtime.messageManager.createMemory({
    id: messageId,
    content: { text: message.content },
    userId: userId,
    roomId: roomId,
    agentId: runtime.agentId
});

// Retrieve recent messages
const recentMessages = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({
roomId: roomId,
count: 10
});

```
</details>


---

## FAQ

### What can services actually do?

Services handle platform-specific communication (like Discord messages or Twitter posts), manage memories and state, and execute actions like processing media or handling commands. Each service adapts these capabilities to its platform while maintaining consistent agent behavior.

### Can multiple services be used simultaneously?
Yes, Eliza supports running multiple services concurrently while maintaining consistent agent behavior across platforms.

### How are service-specific features handled?
Each service implements platform-specific features through its capabilities system, while maintaining a consistent interface for the agent.

### How do services handle rate limits?
Services implement platform-specific rate limiting with backoff strategies and queue management.

### How is service state managed?
Services maintain their own connection state while integrating with the agent's runtime database adapter and memory / state management system.

### How do services handle messages?

Services translate platform messages into Eliza's internal format, process any attachments (images, audio, etc.), maintain conversation context, and manage response queuing and rate limits.

### How are messages processed across services?
Each service processes messages independently in its platform-specific format, while maintaining conversation context through the shared memory system. V2 improves upon this architecture.

### How is state managed between services?
Each service maintains separate state to prevent cross-contamination, but can access shared agent state through the runtime.


### How do services integrate with platforms?

Each service implements platform-specific authentication, API compliance, webhook handling, and follows the platform's rules for rate limiting and content formatting.

### How do services manage memory?

Services use Eliza's memory system to track conversations, user relationships, and state, enabling context-aware responses and persistent interactions across sessions.

---

# Tasks

Tasks in ElizaOS provide a powerful way to manage deferred, scheduled, and interactive operations. The Task system allows agents to queue work for later execution, repeat actions at defined intervals, await user input, and implement complex workflows across multiple interactions.

## Task Structure

A task in ElizaOS has the following properties:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id?: UUID; // Unique identifier (auto-generated if not provided)
  name: string; // Name of the task (must match a registered task worker)
  updatedAt?: number; // Timestamp when the task was last updated
  metadata?: {
    // Optional additional configuration
    updateInterval?: number; // For repeating tasks: milliseconds between executions
    options?: {
      // For choice tasks: options for user selection
      name: string;
      description: string;
    }[];
    [key: string]: unknown; // Additional custom metadata
  };
  description: string; // Human-readable description of the task
  roomId?: UUID; // Optional room association (for room-specific tasks)
  worldId?: UUID; // Optional world association (for world-specific tasks)
  tags: string[]; // Tags for categorizing and filtering tasks
}
```

## Task Workers

Task workers define the actual logic that executes when a task runs. Each task worker is registered with the runtime and is identified by name.

```typescript
interface TaskWorker {
  name: string; // Matches the name in the Task
  execute: (
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    options: { [key: string]: unknown }, // Options passed during execution
    task: Task // The task being executed
  ) => Promise<void>;
  validate?: (
    // Optional validation before execution
    runtime: IAgentRuntime,
    message: Memory,
    state: State
  ) => Promise<boolean>;
}
```

## Creating and Managing Tasks

### Registering a Task Worker

Before creating tasks, you must register a worker to handle the execution:

```typescript
runtime.registerTaskWorker({
  name: 'SEND_REMINDER',
  validate: async (runtime, message, state) => {
    // Optional validation logic
    return true;
  },
  execute: async (runtime, options, task) => {
    // Task execution logic
    const { roomId } = task;
    const { reminder, userId } = options;

    await runtime.createMemory(
      {
        entityId: runtime.agentId,
        roomId,
        content: {
          text: `Reminder for <@${userId}>: ${reminder}`,
        },
      },
      'messages'
    );

    // Delete the task after it's completed
    await runtime.deleteTask(task.id);
  },
});
```

### Creating a One-time Task

Create a task that will execute once:

```typescript
await runtime.createTask({
  name: 'SEND_REMINDER',
  description: 'Send a reminder message to the user',
  roomId: currentRoomId,
  tags: ['reminder', 'one-time'],
  metadata: {
    userId: message.entityId,
    reminder: 'Submit your weekly report',
    scheduledFor: Date.now() + 86400000, // 24 hours from now
  },
});
```

### Creating a Recurring Task

Create a task that repeats at regular intervals:

```typescript
await runtime.createTask({
  name: 'DAILY_REPORT',
  description: 'Generate and post the daily report',
  roomId: announcementChannelId,
  worldId: serverWorldId,
  tags: ['report', 'repeat', 'daily'],
  metadata: {
    updateInterval: 86400000, // 24 hours in milliseconds
    updatedAt: Date.now(), // When the task was last updated/executed
  },
});
```

### Creating a Task Awaiting User Choice

Create a task that presents options and waits for user input:

```typescript
await runtime.createTask({
  name: 'CONFIRM_ACTION',
  description: 'Confirm the requested action',
  roomId: message.roomId,
  tags: ['confirmation', 'AWAITING_CHOICE'],
  metadata: {
    options: [
      { name: 'confirm', description: 'Proceed with the action' },
      { name: 'cancel', description: 'Cancel the action' },
    ],
    action: 'DELETE_FILES',
    files: ['document1.txt', 'document2.txt'],
  },
});
```

### Managing Tasks

Retrieve, update, and delete tasks as needed:

```typescript
// Get tasks by specific criteria
const reminderTasks = await runtime.getTasks({
  roomId: currentRoomId,
  tags: ['reminder'],
});

// Get tasks by name
const reportTasks = await runtime.getTasksByName('DAILY_REPORT');

// Get a specific task
const task = await runtime.getTask(taskId);

// Update a task
await runtime.updateTask(taskId, {
  description: 'Updated description',
  metadata: {
    ...task.metadata,
    priority: 'high',
  },
});

// Delete a task
await runtime.deleteTask(taskId);
```

## Task Processing

Tasks are processed based on their configuration:

### One-time Tasks

Tasks without an `updateInterval` are executed once when triggered by your code. You are responsible for scheduling their execution by checking for pending tasks in appropriate contexts.

### Recurring Tasks

Tasks with an `updateInterval` are automatically considered for re-execution when:

1. The current time exceeds `updatedAt + updateInterval`
2. Your code explicitly checks for pending recurring tasks

To process recurring tasks, implement logic like this:

```typescript
// In an initialization function or periodic check
async function processRecurringTasks() {
  const now = Date.now();
  const recurringTasks = await runtime.getTasks({
    tags: ['repeat'],
  });

  for (const task of recurringTasks) {
    if (!task.metadata?.updateInterval) continue;

    const lastUpdate = task.metadata.updatedAt || 0;
    const interval = task.metadata.updateInterval;

    if (now >= lastUpdate + interval) {
      const worker = runtime.getTaskWorker(task.name);
      if (worker) {
        try {
          await worker.execute(runtime, {}, task);

          // Update the task's last update time
          await runtime.updateTask(task.id, {
            metadata: {
              ...task.metadata,
              updatedAt: now,
            },
          });
        } catch (error) {
          logger.error(`Error executing task ${task.name}: ${error}`);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tasks Awaiting User Input

Tasks tagged with `AWAITING_CHOICE` are presented to users and wait for their input. These tasks use:

1. The `choice` provider to display available options to users
2. The `CHOOSE_OPTION` action to process user selections

## Common Task Patterns

### Deferred Follow-ups

Create a task to follow up with a user later:

```typescript
runtime.registerTaskWorker({
  name: 'FOLLOW_UP',
  execute: async (runtime, options, task) => {
    const { roomId } = task;
    const { userId, topic } = task.metadata;

    await runtime.createMemory(
      {
        entityId: runtime.agentId,
        roomId,
        content: {
          text: `Hi <@${userId}>, I'm following up about ${topic}. Do you have any updates?`,
        },
      },
      'messages'
    );

    await runtime.deleteTask(task.id);
  },
});

// Create a follow-up task for 2 days later
await runtime.createTask({
  name: 'FOLLOW_UP',
  description: 'Follow up with user about project status',
  roomId: message.roomId,
  tags: ['follow-up', 'one-time'],
  metadata: {
    userId: message.entityId,
    topic: 'the project timeline',
    scheduledFor: Date.now() + 2 * 86400000, // 2 days
  },
});
```

### Multi-step Workflows

Implement complex workflows that span multiple interactions:

```typescript
// First step: Gather requirements
runtime.registerTaskWorker({
  name: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS',
  execute: async (runtime, options, task) => {
    // Ask user for requirements and create a new task for the next step
    await runtime.createTask({
      name: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS',
      description: 'Confirm gathered requirements',
      roomId: task.roomId,
      tags: ['workflow', 'AWAITING_CHOICE'],
      metadata: {
        previousStep: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS',
        requirements: options.requirements,
        options: [
          { name: 'confirm', description: 'Confirm requirements are correct' },
          { name: 'revise', description: 'Need to revise requirements' },
        ],
      },
    });

    await runtime.deleteTask(task.id);
  },
});

// Second step: Confirm requirements
runtime.registerTaskWorker({
  name: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS',
  execute: async (runtime, options, task) => {
    if (options.option === 'confirm') {
      // Move to the next step
      await runtime.createTask({
        name: 'GENERATE_SOLUTION',
        description: 'Generate solution based on requirements',
        roomId: task.roomId,
        tags: ['workflow'],
        metadata: {
          previousStep: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS',
          requirements: task.metadata.requirements,
        },
      });
    } else {
      // Go back to requirements gathering
      await runtime.createTask({
        name: 'GATHER_REQUIREMENTS',
        description: 'Revise requirements',
        roomId: task.roomId,
        tags: ['workflow'],
        metadata: {
          previousStep: 'CONFIRM_REQUIREMENTS',
          previousRequirements: task.metadata.requirements,
        },
      });
    }

    await runtime.deleteTask(task.id);
  },
});
```

### Scheduled Reports

Create tasks that generate and post reports on a schedule:

```typescript
runtime.registerTaskWorker({
  name: 'GENERATE_WEEKLY_REPORT',
  execute: async (runtime, options, task) => {
    const { roomId } = task;

    // Generate report content
    const reportData = await generateWeeklyReport(runtime);

    // Post the report
    await runtime.createMemory(
      {
        entityId: runtime.agentId,
        roomId,
        content: {
          text: `# Weekly Report\n\n${reportData}`,
        },
      },
      'messages'
    );

    // The task stays active for next week (updateInterval handles timing)
  },
});

// Create a weekly report task
await runtime.createTask({
  name: 'GENERATE_WEEKLY_REPORT',
  description: 'Generate and post weekly activity report',
  roomId: reportChannelId,
  worldId: serverWorldId,
  tags: ['report', 'repeat', 'weekly'],
  metadata: {
    updateInterval: 7 * 86400000, // 7 days
    updatedAt: Date.now(),
    format: 'markdown',
  },
});
```

## Task Events and Monitoring

ElizaOS doesn't currently provide built-in events for task lifecycle, so implement your own monitoring if needed:

```typescript
// Custom monitoring for task execution
async function executeTaskWithMonitoring(runtime, taskWorker, task) {
  try {
    // Create a start log
    await runtime.log({
      body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'start' },
      entityId: runtime.agentId,
      roomId: task.roomId,
      type: 'TASK_EXECUTION',
    });

    // Execute the task
    await taskWorker.execute(runtime, {}, task);

    // Create a completion log
    await runtime.log({
      body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'complete', success: true },
      entityId: runtime.agentId,
      roomId: task.roomId,
      type: 'TASK_EXECUTION',
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Create an error log
    await runtime.log({
      body: { taskId: task.id, action: 'error', error: error.message },
      entityId: runtime.agentId,
      roomId: task.roomId,
      type: 'TASK_EXECUTION',
    });
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names and descriptions**: Make tasks easily identifiable with clear names and descriptions

2. **Clean up completed tasks**: Delete one-time tasks after execution to prevent database bloat

3. **Add error handling**: Implement robust error handling in task workers to prevent failures from breaking workflows

4. **Use appropriate tags**: Tag tasks effectively for easy retrieval and categorization

5. **Validate carefully**: Use the `validate` function to ensure tasks only execute in appropriate contexts

6. **Keep tasks atomic**: Design tasks to perform specific, well-defined operations rather than complex actions

7. **Provide clear choices**: When creating choice tasks, make option names and descriptions clear and unambiguous

8. **Manage task lifecycles**: Have a clear strategy for when tasks are created, updated, and deleted

9. **Set reasonable intervals**: For recurring tasks, choose appropriate update intervals that balance timeliness and resource usage

10. **Handle concurrent execution**: Ensure task execution is idempotent to handle potential concurrent executions

# Worlds

Worlds in ElizaOS are collections of entities (users, agents) and rooms (conversations, channels) that form a cohesive environment for interactions. Think of a world as a virtual space, like a Discord server, Slack workspace, or 3D MMO environment, where entities can communicate across multiple channels or areas.

![](/img/elizaos-worlds-cosmic-clean.svg)

Within each world you can have rooms, which are akin to individual threads or channels in a server.

![](/img/elizaos-worlds-simplified.svg)

## World Structure

A world in ElizaOS has the following properties:

```typescript
type World = {
  id: UUID;
  name?: string;
  agentId: UUID;
  serverId: string;
  metadata?: {
    ownership?: {
      ownerId: string;
    };
    roles?: {
      [entityId: UUID]: Role;
    };
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
};
```

| Property   | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Unique identifier for the world                      |
| `name`     | Optional display name                                |
| `agentId`  | ID of the agent managing this world                  |
| `serverId` | External system identifier (e.g., Discord server ID) |
| `metadata` | Additional world configuration data                  |

The metadata can store custom information, including ownership details and role assignments for entities within the world.

## World Creation and Management

### Creating a World

You can create a new world using the AgentRuntime:

```typescript
const worldId = await runtime.createWorld({
  name: 'My Project Space',
  agentId: runtime.agentId,
  serverId: 'external-system-id',
  metadata: {
    ownership: {
      ownerId: ownerEntityId,
    },
  },
});
```

For many integrations, worlds are automatically created during connection setup with external platforms like Discord or Slack.

### Ensuring a World Exists

If you're not sure if a world exists, you can use `ensureWorldExists()`:

```typescript
await runtime.ensureWorldExists({
  id: worldId,
  name: 'My Project Space',
  agentId: runtime.agentId,
  serverId: 'external-system-id',
});
```

### Retrieving World Information

```typescript
// Get a specific world
const world = await runtime.getWorld(worldId);

// Get all worlds
const allWorlds = await runtime.getAllWorlds();
```

### Updating World Properties

```typescript
await runtime.updateWorld({
  id: worldId,
  name: 'Updated Name',
  metadata: {
    ...world.metadata,
    customProperty: 'value',
  },
});
```

## World Roles System

Worlds support a role-based permission system with the following roles:

| Role    | Description                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `OWNER` | Full control over the world, can assign any roles     |
| `ADMIN` | Administrative capabilities, can manage most settings |
| `NONE`  | Standard participant with no special permissions      |

### Managing Roles

Roles are stored in the world's metadata and can be updated:

```typescript
// Get existing world
const world = await runtime.getWorld(worldId);

// Ensure roles object exists
if (!world.metadata) world.metadata = {};
if (!world.metadata.roles) world.metadata.roles = {};

// Assign a role to an entity
world.metadata.roles[entityId] = Role.ADMIN;

// Save the world
await runtime.updateWorld(world);
```

For programmatic role management, you can use role-related utilities:

```typescript
import { canModifyRole, findWorldForOwner } from '@elizaos/core';

// Check if user can modify roles
if (canModifyRole(userRole, targetRole, newRole)) {
  // Allow role change
}

// Find world where user is owner
const userWorld = await findWorldForOwner(runtime, entityId);
```

## World Settings

Worlds support configurable settings that can be stored and retrieved:

```typescript
// Get settings for a world
const worldSettings = await getWorldSettings(runtime, serverId);

// Update world settings
worldSettings.MY_SETTING = {
  name: 'My Setting',
  description: 'Description for users',
  value: 'setting-value',
  required: false,
};

// Save settings
await updateWorldSettings(runtime, serverId, worldSettings);
```

## World Events

ElizaOS emits events related to world activities:

| Event             | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `WORLD_JOINED`    | Emitted when an agent joins a world            |
| `WORLD_CONNECTED` | Emitted when a world is successfully connected |
| `WORLD_LEFT`      | Emitted when an agent leaves a world           |

### Handling World Events

```typescript
// Register event handlers in your plugin
const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-world-plugin',
  description: 'Handles world events',

  events: {
    [EventTypes.WORLD_JOINED]: [
      async (payload: WorldPayload) => {
        const { world, runtime } = payload;
        console.log(`Joined world: ${world.name}`);
      },
    ],

    [EventTypes.WORLD_LEFT]: [
      async (payload: WorldPayload) => {
        const { world, runtime } = payload;
        console.log(`Left world: ${world.name}`);
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Relationship with Rooms

A world contains multiple rooms that entities can interact in. Each room points back to its parent world via the `worldId` property.

```typescript
// Get all rooms in a world
const worldRooms = await runtime.getRooms(worldId);
```

See the [Rooms](./rooms.md) documentation for more details on managing rooms within worlds.

## Best Practices

1. **Always check permissions**: Before performing administrative actions, verify the user has appropriate roles
2. **Handle world metadata carefully**: The metadata object can contain critical configuration, so modify it with care
3. **World-room syncing**: When syncing with external platforms, keep world and room structures in alignment
4. **Event-driven architecture**: Use events to respond to world changes rather than polling for updates
5. **Default settings**: Provide sensible defaults for world settings to make configuration easier

description: Get started quickly with ElizaOS - from installation to running your first AI agent
keywords:
  [quickstart, installation, setup, configuration, CLI, agents, plugins, development, deployment]
image: /img/eliza_banner.jpg
---

# Quickstart Guide

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Git for version control
- For Windows Users: [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required

## Installation

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="global" label="Install Globally (Recommended)" default>

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @elizaos/cli
# Start ElizaOS
elizaos start
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="Test with NPX">

```bash
# Use directly with npx
npx @elizaos/cli start
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="Install from Source">

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:elizaOS/eliza.git
cd eliza

# Switch to development branch
git checkout main

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build

# Start ElizaOS
bun start
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will:

1. Start ElizaOS with default settings
2. Load the default character
3. Make the agent accessible via terminal and REST API

> **Note:** If you encounter any errors on first startup, try running the start command again. The initial startup sometimes needs a second attempt to properly initialize all components.

### Chat with your agent:

Visit https://localhost:3000 to interact with your agent through a web interface.

## 2. Creating a Project

If you want to create a custom ElizaOS project with your own characters and configurations:

```bash
# Create a new project with the interactive wizard
elizaos create
# Or specify project type directly
elizaos create --type project
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your project. Once created:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project-name
# Start your project
elizaos start
```

> If it fails the first time try the start command again

### Project Structure

A typical ElizaOS project structure looks like this:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts      # Main entry point with character definitions
├── knowledge/        # Knowledge files for RAG
├── package.json      # Project configuration and dependencies
└── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
```

The character definition is located in `src/index.ts` where you can modify the agent's personality, plugins, and settings. This is the core file for customizing your agent's behavior.

### Add plugins to your project:

```bash
# List available plugins for a project
elizaos plugins list
# Add a plugin
elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-discord
```

### Working with Character Files

You can work with character files using the agent commands:

```bash
# Create a new character file
elizaos create -t agent my-character

# Start an agent with a character file
elizaos agent start --path ./my-character.json

# Get agent details and save to file
elizaos agent get --name eliza --output my-exported-character.json

# Start agent with JSON configuration directly
elizaos agent start --json '{"name":"Eliza","system":"You are a helpful assistant","bio":["Helpful AI assistant"],...}'

# Load character from remote URL
elizaos agent start --remote-character https://example.com/characters/assistant.json
```

This is particularly useful for those migrating from v1 who are used to working with standalone character files.

## 3. Creating a Plugin

Want to extend ElizaOS with custom functionality?

```bash
# Create a new plugin project
elizaos create --type plugin
```

Develop your plugin following the structure in your generated project:

```bash
# Test your plugin
elizaos start
# Publish your plugin when ready
elizaos publish
```

### Publishing options:

```bash
# Test publish without making changes
elizaos publish --test
# Publish to npm instead of GitHub
elizaos publish --npm
# Generate files locally without publishing
elizaos publish --dry-run
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Node Version

- Use Node.js 23.3.0+ (`node -v` to check)
- Try using NVM: `nvm use 23`

### Installation Problems

```bash
# Clean and reinstall
bun clean
bun install --no-frozen-lockfile
bun build
```

### Plugin Issues

```bash
# Rebuild problematic packages
bun rebuild better-sqlite3
```

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Clean up Docker environment
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
docker builder prune -a -f
```

### First-time Startup Issues

If your agent fails to start on the first attempt:

- Run the start command again
- Check logs for specific errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify that your database configuration is correct

---

# Plugins

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Plugins are modular extensions that enhance the capabilities of ElizaOS agents. They provide a flexible way to add new functionality, integrate external services, and customize agent behavior across different platforms.

:::info
Key Improvements in V2

1. **Unified API**: Almost everything is accessible via `runtime.methodName()` in the agent runtime for simpler development
2. **Enhanced Model System**: The new `useModel` approach allows for flexible model provider registration
3. **Events System**: Formal support for event-based programming
4. **Plugin Creation Workflow**: Simplified creation and testing via CLI
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Built-in support for plugin testing
6. **No Monorepo Required**: Complete plugin development without touching the core codebase
7. **Plugin Registry**: Manages the catalog of available plugins and handles their registration with the runtime
8. **Bootstrap Plugin**: Initializes core functionality required for all agents to operate
   :::

The ElizaOS plugin system maintains the same basic concept as previous versions, with several new extension points (events, routes, tests, models) and features that significantly improve the developer experience.

**Browse plugins the elizaOS community made here: [Package Showcase](/packages)**

[![](/img/plugins.png)](/packages)

> elizaOS maintains an official package registry at [github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).

---

## Quick Start

The new CLI tool introduces a streamlined workflow for plugin development without ever needing to touch the ElizaOS monorepo directly:

1. **Create**: `bun create eliza` - Initialize a new plugin project with proper structure
2. **Develop**: Edit the plugin code in the generated project structure
3. **Test**: `elizaos test` - Test the plugin functionality
4. **Run**: `elizaos start` - Run the plugin with a default agent
5. **Publish**: `elizaos publish` - Share your plugin with others

### Creating a New Plugin

You can create a new ElizaOS plugin using the CLI:

```bash
# Using bun (recommended)
bun create eliza

# Or using bunx
bunx create-eliza
```

When prompted, select "Plugin" as the type to create. The CLI will guide you through the setup process, creating a plugin with the proper structure and dependencies.

---

### Managing Plugins

There are several ways to add plugins to your ElizaOS project:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="package" label="Via package.json">
    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@elizaos/plugin-solana": "github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana",
        "@elizaos/plugin-farcaster": "github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="character" label="Via Character Definition">
    ```typescript
    // In src/index.ts
    export const character: Character = {
      name: 'MyAgent',
      plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-farcaster', '@elizaos/plugin-example'],
      // ...
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Via CLI Commands">
    ```bash
    # Add a plugin
    elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-farcaster

    # Remove a plugin
    elizaos plugins remove @elizaos/plugin-farcaster

    # List available plugins
    elizaos plugins list
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Plugin Configuration

Configure plugin settings in your character definition:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-example"],
  "settings": {
    "example": {
      "enableFeatureX": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Plugin Loading Process

The AgentRuntime automatically loads the Bootstrap Plugin during initialization, before any other plugins:

```typescript
async initialize() {
  // Register bootstrap plugin
  await this.registerPlugin(bootstrapPlugin);

  // Then register additional plugins
  for (const plugin of this.plugins) {
    await this.registerPlugin(plugin);
  }

  // Initialize other components
  // ...
}
```

---

### Publishing Plugins

If you're a plugin developer, you can publish your plugin to make it available to others. The ElizaOS CLI provides several options for publishing your plugin depending on your needs.

First, make sure your plugin is built and ready for distribution:

```bash
# Navigate to your plugin directory
cd my-eliza-plugin

# Build your plugin
npm run build
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub Publishing">
    Publishing to GitHub is the recommended approach for sharing your plugin with the ElizaOS community:

    ```bash
    # Publish to GitHub
    elizaos publish
    ```

    This will:
    1. Build and package your plugin
    2. Create or update a GitHub repository in the elizaos-plugins organization
    3. Add your plugin to the ElizaOS registry (if you're a registry maintainer)

    For first-time publishers, the CLI will guide you through setting up GitHub credentials for publishing.

    GitHub publishing is ideal for open-source plugins that you want to share with the community and have listed in the official registry.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm Publishing">
    You can also publish your plugin to npm:

    ```bash
    # Publish to npm
    elizaos publish --npm
    ```

    This allows users to install your plugin using standard npm commands:

    ```bash
    npm install @your-scope/plugin-name
    ```

    npm publishing is useful when you want to:
    - Maintain your own package namespace
    - Integrate with existing npm workflows
    - Set up automated versioning and releases

    Make sure your package.json is properly configured with the correct name, version, and access permissions.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="testing" label="Test Mode">
    Before publishing, you can validate the process without making any external changes:

    ```bash
    # Test the publish process
    elizaos publish --test
    ```

    This runs through all the packaging and validation steps without actually publishing anything.

    Test mode is helpful for:
    - Verifying your plugin structure is correct
    - Ensuring all required files are present
    - Checking that dependencies are properly configured
    - Validating that your plugin can be built successfully

    Always run in test mode before your first public release to avoid issues.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="customizing" label="Additional Options">
    The publish command supports several additional options to customize the publishing process:

    ```bash
    # Specify platform compatibility
    elizaos publish --platform node

    # Set custom version number
    elizaos publish --version 1.2.3

    # Provide a custom registry URL
    elizaos publish --registry https://custom-registry.com

    # Publish with public access
    elizaos publish --access public
    ```

    These options give you fine-grained control over how and where your plugin is published. Refer to `elizaos publish --help` for a complete list of options.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
When submitting a plugin to the [elizaOS Registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), include:

1. **Working Demo**: Screenshots or video of your plugin in action
2. **Test Results**: Evidence of successful integration and error handling
3. **Configuration Example**: Show how to properly configure your plugin
   :::

---

## Plugin Architecture

Eliza uses a unified plugin architecture where everything is a plugin - including services, adapters, actions, evaluators, and providers. This approach ensures consistent behavior and better extensibility.

### Plugin Components

Each plugin can provide one or more of the following components:

| Component          | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Services**       | Platform integrations (Discord, Telegram, etc.) or specialized capabilities      |
| **Actions**        | Executable functions triggered by the agent (reply, generate content, etc.)     |
| **Providers**      | Context providers that supply info to the agent during decision making          |
| **Evaluators**     | Analyze conversations to extract insights and improve future interactions       |
| **Adapters**       | Database or storage system integrations                                         |
| **Model Handlers** | Register handlers for different model types (text generation, embeddings, etc.) |
| **Event Handlers** | React to system events like messages, connections, or actions                   |
| **API Routes**     | Add custom REST endpoints to the agent's HTTP interface                         |
| **Tests**          | Include test suites to verify plugin functionality                              |

### Plugin Interface

All plugins implement the core Plugin interface:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  config?: { [key: string]: any };

  // Optional initialization method
  init?: (config: Record<string, string>, runtime: IAgentRuntime) => Promise<void>;

  // Components
  services?: (typeof Service)[];
  actions?: Action[];
  providers?: Provider[];
  evaluators?: Evaluator[];
  adapters?: Adapter[];

  // Additional features
  routes?: Route[];
  tests?: TestSuite[];
  events?: { [key: string]: ((params: any) => Promise<any>)[] };
}
```

### Service Implementation

Services are the core integration points for external platforms. A properly implemented service:

```typescript
import { Service, IAgentRuntime } from '@elizaos/core';

export class ExampleService extends Service {
  // Required: Define the service type (used for runtime registration)
  static serviceType = 'example';

  // Required: Describe what this service enables the agent to do
  capabilityDescription = 'Enables the agent to interact with the Example platform';

  // Store runtime for service operations
  constructor(protected runtime: IAgentRuntime) {
    super();
    // Initialize connections, setup event handlers, etc.
  }

  // Required: Static method to create and initialize service instance
  static async start(runtime: IAgentRuntime): Promise<ExampleService> {
    const service = new ExampleService(runtime);
    // Additional initialization if needed
    return service;
  }

  // Required: Clean up resources when service is stopped
  async stop(): Promise<void> {
    // Close connections, release resources
  }

  // Optional: Custom methods for your service functionality
  async sendMessage(content: string, channelId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

## Plugin Structure

Each plugin repository should follow this structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── images/                # Branding assets
│   ├── logo.png           # Square logo (400x400px)
│   ├── banner.png         # Banner image (1280x640px)
│   └── screenshots/       # Feature screenshots
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Main plugin entry point
│   ├── service.ts         # Service implementation
│   ├── actions/           # Plugin-specific actions
│   ├── providers/         # Data providers
│   ├── types.ts           # Type definitions
│   └── environment.ts     # Configuration validation
├── tests/                 # Test suite
├── package.json           # Plugin configuration and dependencies
└── README.md              # Plugin documentation
```

### Plugin Entry Point

Your plugin's `index.ts` should export a Plugin object:

```typescript
// Example plugin implementation
import { type Plugin } from '@elizaos/core';
import { ExampleService } from './service';
import { searchAction } from './actions/search';
import { statusProvider } from './providers/status';

const examplePlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'example',
  description: 'Example platform integration for ElizaOS',
  services: [ExampleService],
  actions: [searchAction],
  providers: [statusProvider],
  init: async (config, runtime) => {
    // Perform any necessary initialization
    const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_API_KEY');
    if (!apiKey) {
      console.warn('EXAMPLE_API_KEY not provided');
    }
  },
};

export default examplePlugin;
```

### Plugin Configuration

Your plugin's `package.json` should include an `agentConfig` section:

```json
{
  "name": "@elizaos/plugin-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agentConfig": {
    "pluginType": "elizaos:plugin:1.0.0",
    "pluginParameters": {
      "API_KEY": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "API key for the Example service"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables and Secrets

Plugins access configuration through the runtime with the following precedence:

1. Character settings secrets (highest priority)
2. Character settings
3. Global environment settings

#### Access Pattern

```typescript
// In your service implementation
const apiKey = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_API_KEY');
const debugMode = runtime.getSetting('EXAMPLE_DEBUG_MODE'); // Returns boolean for "true"/"false" strings
```

#### Configuration in Character File

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-example"],
  "settings": {
    "example": {
      "enableFeatureX": true
    },
    "secrets": {
      "EXAMPLE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Bootstrap Plugin

The Bootstrap Plugin is a foundational component of ElizaOS that initializes the core functionality required for agents to operate. It's automatically loaded as part of the initialization process, establishing the minimum viable capabilities that all agents need.

```typescript
export const bootstrapPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'bootstrap',
  description: 'Agent bootstrap with basic actions and evaluators',
  actions: [...],
  events: {...},
  evaluators: [...],
  providers: [...],
  services: [TaskService, ScenarioService],
};
```

The Bootstrap Plugin registers essential components across several categories to provide a foundation for all agents. These components can be extended by custom plugins.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="actions" label="Actions">
    | Action                 | Description                                     |
    | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | `replyAction`          | Generates and sends a response to a message     |
    | `followRoomAction`     | Enables an agent to actively follow a room      |
    | `unfollowRoomAction`   | Stops an agent from following a room            |
    | `muteRoomAction`       | Mutes notifications from a room                 |
    | `unmuteRoomAction`     | Unmutes notifications from a room               |
    | `sendMessageAction`    | Sends a message to a specific room              |
    | `ignoreAction`         | Explicitly ignores a message                    |
    | `noneAction`           | Acknowledges a message without taking action    |
    | `updateEntityAction`   | Updates properties of an entity                 |

  <TabItem value="events" label="Event Handlers">
    The Bootstrap Plugin registers handlers for key system events that enable the core message processing flow:

    **Core Events:**
    - `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` - Processes new messages and generates responses
    - `REACTION_RECEIVED` - Tracks reactions to messages
    - `VOICE_MESSAGE_RECEIVED` - Handles audio messages
    - `POST_GENERATED` - Creates social media content
    - `MESSAGE_SENT` - Logs outgoing messages

    **World Events:**
    - `WORLD_JOINED` / `WORLD_CONNECTED` - Synchronizes data when joining worlds
    - `ENTITY_JOINED` / `ENTITY_LEFT` - Manages entity presence

    **Lifecycle Events:**
    - `ACTION_STARTED` / `ACTION_COMPLETED` - Tracks action execution
    - `EVALUATOR_STARTED` / `EVALUATOR_COMPLETED` - Monitors evaluator processing
    - `RUN_STARTED` / `RUN_ENDED` / `RUN_TIMEOUT` - Manages message processing lifecycle

    The message processing flow follows these steps:
    1. Receive message via `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event
    2. Save message to memory
    3. Check if agent should respond
    4. If responding, compose state from providers
    5. Generate a response using the language model
    6. Process any actions specified in the response
    7. Run evaluators on the conversation
    8. Emit lifecycle events throughout the process

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Extending Bootstrap Functionality

While the Bootstrap Plugin provides core functionality, it's designed to be extended by other plugins. Custom plugins can:

1. **Add new actions** - Extend the agent's capabilities
2. **Register additional providers** - Supply more contextual information
3. **Add evaluators** - Create new ways to analyze and learn from interactions
4. **Handle additional events** - React to more system events
5. **Initialize custom services** - Provide new functionality

When working with plugins in relation to the Bootstrap Plugin:

1. **Don't modify bootstrap directly** - Instead, create custom plugins to extend functionality
2. **Understand provider contribution** - Know how each provider contributes to the agent's context
3. **Learn the core actions** - Become familiar with the actions that all agents can perform
4. **Leverage event handlers** - Use the event system for reactive behavior
5. **Extend, don't replace** - Build on top of bootstrap functionality rather than replacing it

---

## Developing a Plugin

When developing a new plugin, focus on these key aspects:

1. **Service Implementation**: Create a solid service class following the pattern above
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Handle API failures gracefully
3. **Type Definitions**: Define clear interfaces and types
4. **Documentation**: Include detailed setup instructions
5. **Tests**: Add test cases for your functionality

### Testing Your Plugin

During development, you can test your plugin locally:

```bash
# Start with your plugin
elizaos start --plugins=./path/to/plugin

# Or with a specific character
elizaos start --character=./characters/test.character.json --plugins=./path/to/plugin
```

### Distribution & PR Requirements

When submitting a plugin to the [elizaOS Registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), include:

1. **Working Demo**: Screenshots or video of your plugin in action
2. **Test Results**: Evidence of successful integration and error handling
3. **Configuration Example**: Show how to properly configure your plugin
4. **Quality Checklist**:
   - [ ] Plugin follows the standard structure
   - [ ] Required branding assets are included
   - [ ] Documentation is complete
   - [ ] GitHub topics properly set
   - [ ] Tests are passing
   - [ ] Includes error handling

## FAQ

### What exactly is a plugin in ElizaOS?

A plugin is a modular extension that adds new capabilities to ElizaOS agents, such as API integrations, custom actions, or platform connections. Plugins allow you to expand agent functionality and share reusable components with other developers.

### When should I create a plugin versus using existing ones?

Create a plugin when you need custom functionality not available in existing plugins, want to integrate with external services, or plan to share reusable agent capabilities with the community.

### How do I manage plugin dependencies?

Plugin dependencies are managed through your project's `package.json`. You can add plugins directly using npm or the ElizaOS CLI, and they will be automatically loaded when your project starts.

### Can I use a plugin in development before publishing?

Yes, you can use the `--plugins` flag with the `start` command to include local plugins during development:

```bash
elizaos start --plugins=./path/to/plugin
```

### What's the difference between Actions and Services?

Actions handle specific agent responses or behaviors, while Services provide platform integrations (like Discord or Telegram) or ongoing background functionality that multiple actions might use.

### How do I handle rate limits with external APIs?

Implement proper backoff strategies in your service implementation and consider using a queue system for message handling to respect platform rate limits.

# 📝 ElizaOS Projects

Projects are the main organizational structure in ElizaOS, containing all the necessary components to create and deploy AI agents. A project can include one or more agents, each with their own character definition, plugins, and configurations.

## Project Structure

A typical ElizaOS project structure:

```
my-eliza-project/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts        # Main entry point
├── knowledge/          # Knowledge base files
├── package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
```

## Creating a New Project

You can create a new ElizaOS project using:

```bash
# Using bun (recommended)
bun create eliza

# Or using bunx
bunx @elizaos/cli create
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process, including:

- Project name
- Database selection (sqlite, postgres, etc.)
- Initial configuration

## Project Configuration

The main project file (`src/index.ts`) exports a default project object:

```typescript
import type { Character, IAgentRuntime, Project, ProjectAgent } from '@elizaos/core';
import customPlugin from './plugin';

// Define the character
export const character: Character = {
  name: 'Agent Name',
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-discord', '@elizaos/plugin-direct'],
  // Other character properties
};

// Create a ProjectAgent that includes the character
export const projectAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  character,
  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
    // Initialize agent-specific functionality
    console.log('Initializing agent:', character.name);
  },
  plugins: [customPlugin],
  tests: [], // Optional tests for your agent
};

// Export the full project with all agents
const project: Project = {
  agents: [projectAgent],
};

export default project;
```

## Character Configuration

Each agent in your project requires a character definition that controls its personality, knowledge, and behavior.

### Required Character Fields

```typescript
{
  name: "agentName", // Character's display name
  plugins: ["@elizaos/plugin-discord"], // Example plugins
  settings: {
    // Configuration settings
    secrets: {}, // API keys and sensitive data
    voice: {}, // Voice configuration
  },
  bio: [], // Character background as a string or array of statements
  style: {
    // Interaction style guide
    all: [], // General style rules
    chat: [], // Chat-specific style
    post: [] // Post-specific style
  }
}
```

### Plugins

Plugins provide your agent with capabilities and integrations:

- `@elizaos/plugin-discord`: Discord integration
- `@elizaos/plugin-telegram`: Telegram integration
- `@elizaos/plugin-farcaster`: Farcaster integration
- `@elizaos/plugin-slack`: Slack integration
- `@elizaos/plugin-direct`: Direct chat interface
- `@elizaos/plugin-simsai`: SimsAI platform integration

View all available plugins: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry

### Settings Configuration

The `settings` object supports various configurations:

```typescript
{
  "settings": {
    "ragKnowledge": false, // Enable RAG knowledge mode
    "voice": {
      "model": "string", // Voice synthesis model
      "url": "string" // Optional voice API URL
    },
    "secrets": {
      // API keys (use env vars in production)
      "API_KEY": "string"
    },
  }
}
```

### Bio & Style

Define your agent's personality and communication style:

```typescript
{
  "bio": ["Expert in blockchain development", "Specializes in DeFi protocols"],
  "style": {
    "all": [
      // Applied to all interactions
      "Keep responses clear",
      "Maintain professional tone"
    ],
    "chat": [
      // Chat-specific style
      "Engage with curiosity",
      "Provide explanations"
    ],
    "post": [
      // Social post style
      "Keep posts informative",
      "Focus on key points"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Style Tips**

- Be specific about tone and mannerisms
- Include platform-specific guidance
- Define clear boundaries and limitations

### Optional Character Fields

```typescript
{
  "username": "handle", // Character's username/handle
  "system": "System prompt text", // Custom system prompt
  "lore": [], // Additional background/history
  "knowledge": [
    // Knowledge base entries
    "Direct string knowledge",
    { "path": "file/path.md", "shared": false },
    { "directory": "knowledge/path", "shared": false }
  ],
  "messageExamples": [], // Example conversations
  "postExamples": [], // Example social posts
  "topics": [], // Areas of expertise
  "adjectives": [] // Character traits
}
```

## Knowledge Management

ElizaOS supports two knowledge modes:

### Classic Mode (Default)

- Direct string knowledge added to character's context
- No chunking or semantic search
- Enabled by default (`settings.ragKnowledge: false`)
- Only processes string knowledge entries
- Simpler but less sophisticated

### RAG Mode

- Advanced knowledge processing with semantic search
- Chunks content and uses embeddings
- Must be explicitly enabled (`settings.ragKnowledge: true`)
- Supports three knowledge types:
  1. Direct string knowledge
  2. Single file references: `{ "path": "path/to/file.md", "shared": false }`
  3. Directory references: `{ "directory": "knowledge/dir", "shared": false }`
- Supported file types: .md, .txt, .pdf
- Optional `shared` flag for knowledge reuse across characters

### Knowledge Path Configuration

- Knowledge files are relative to the project's `knowledge` directory
- Paths should not contain `../` (sanitized for security)
- Both shared and private knowledge supported
- Files automatically reloaded if content changes

## Example Project

Here's a complete example of a project configuration:

```typescript
import type { Character, IAgentRuntime, Project, ProjectAgent } from '@elizaos/core';

export const character: Character = {
  name: 'Tech Helper',
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-discord', '@elizaos/plugin-direct'],
  settings: {
    ragKnowledge: true,
    voice: {
      model: 'en_US-male-medium',
    },
    discord: {
      shouldRespondOnlyToMentions: false,
      allowedChannelIds: ['123456789012345678'],
    },
  },
  bio: ['Friendly technical assistant', 'Specializes in explaining complex topics simply'],
  lore: ['Pioneer in open-source AI development', 'Advocate for AI accessibility'],
  messageExamples: [
    [
      {
        name: 'user1',
        content: { text: 'Can you explain how AI models work?' },
      },
      {
        name: 'TechAI',
        content: {
          text: 'Think of AI models like pattern recognition systems.',
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
  topics: ['artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'technology education'],
  knowledge: [
    {
      directory: 'tech_guides',
      shared: true,
    },
  ],
  style: {
    all: ['Clear', 'Patient', 'Educational'],
    chat: ['Interactive', 'Supportive'],
    post: ['Concise', 'Informative'],
  },
};

export const projectAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  character,
  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
    console.log('Initializing Tech Helper agent');
  },
  plugins: [], // Project-specific plugins
};

const project: Project = {
  agents: [projectAgent],
};

export default project;
```

## Character File Export

While projects are the primary structure in ElizaOS, you can still export standalone character files for compatibility with other systems or sharing character definitions:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import { character } from './src/index';

// Export character to JSON file
fs.writeFileSync('character.json', JSON.stringify(character, null, 2));
```

## Managing Multiple Agents

A project can contain multiple agents, each with its own character and plugins:

```typescript
const project: Project = {
  agents: [
    {
      character: technicalSupportCharacter,
      init: async (runtime) => {
        /* init code */
      },
      plugins: [customSupportPlugin],
    },
    {
      character: communityManagerCharacter,
      init: async (runtime) => {
        /* init code */
      },
      plugins: [communityPlugin],
    },
  ],
};
```

Each agent operates independently but can share the same database and resources.

## Running Your Project

After configuring your project, you can run it using:

```bash
elizaos start
```

This will start your agents according to your project configuration.
