# "What Did You Get Done This Week?" Recap

From November 2024 to January 2025, we held a weekly Twitter Spaces where developers shared progress about their AI agent projects. If you shipped something related to open source AI / social agents that week, you were allowed 1-2 minutes to share an update of what you have been working on. Thousands of listeners tuned every Friday night to essentially listen to a dev standup.

The WDYGDTW series played a role in establishing momentum and maintaining it throughout the formative months as the crypto x AI agent space was heating up. The weekly accountability structure encouraged:

- **Rapid iteration cycles** from concept to implementation
- **Cross-pollination of ideas** between different teams
- **Public documentation** of the ecosystem's growth
- **Establishment of norms** around open development
- **Community reputation building** through consistent delivery

## Timeline

We transcribed, summarized, and uplaoded notes for every Space shortly after each one. However, until now the recordings and notes haven't all been easily accessible all in one place. Showing up is half the battle. These are the pioneers of a grassroots crypto / AI movement.

These recordings help document the week-by-week evolution of the crypto AI ecosystem, capturing the iterative development process and community formation in real-time. NotebookLM and similar research tools can extract specific technical discussions, discover new connections, and track project evolution through these as sources.

Below is a complete list of all WDYGDTW session recordings. These videos can be imported into tools like Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) via youtube video import for deeper analysis, transcript generation, and pattern recognition across the development timeline:

If you do something cool with this data, let us know in the [discord](discord.gg/ai16z)!

After 3 straight months of nonstop building, it was time for a rest period. We may bring this format back, but we also want to continue the spirit of public accountability and transparent development through other community initiatives to keep things fresh. One such example is [Clank Tank](https://m3org.com/tv), where a standup becomes a pitch to AI judges that give you feedback about your project.
