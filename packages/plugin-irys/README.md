# @elizaos/plugin-irys

A plugin for ElizaOS that enables decentralized data storage and retrieval using Irys, a programmable datachain platform.

## Overview

This plugin integrates Irys functionality into ElizaOS, allowing agents to store and retrieve data in a decentralized manner. It provides a robust service for creating a decentralized knowledge base and enabling multi-agent collaboration.

## Installation

To install this plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm add @elizaos/plugin-irys
```


## Features

- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Store data permanently on the Irys network
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch stored data using GraphQL queries
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Enable data sharing and collaboration between agents
- **Ethereum Integration**: Built-in support for Ethereum wallet authentication

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables:

- `EVM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your EVM wallet private key
- `AGENTS_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEYS`: The public keys of the agents that will be used to retrieve the data

For this plugin to work, you need to have an EVM (Base network)wallet with a private key and public address. To prevent any security issues, we recommend using a dedicated wallet for this plugin.

## Usage

### Uploading Data

To upload data to the Irys network, you can use the `uploadData` function. This function will upload the data to the Irys network and return the transaction hash.

```typescript
const { IrysService } = require('@elizaos/plugin-irys');

const irysService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IRYS)
const data = "Hello, world!";
const transactionResult = await irysService.uploadStringToIrys(data);
console.log(`Data uploaded successfully. Transaction hash: ${transactionResult}`);
```

### Retrieving Data

To retrieve data from the Irys network, you can use the `getDataFromAnAgent` function. This function will retrieve the data from the Irys network and return the data.

```typescript
const { IrysService } = require('@elizaos/plugin-irys');

const irysService = runtime.getService(ServiceType.IRYS)
const agentsWalletPublicKeys = runtime.getSetting("AGENTS_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEYS");
const data = await irysService.getDataFromAnAgent(agentsWalletPublicKeys);
console.log(`Data retrieved successfully. Data: ${data}`);
```

## About Irys

Irys is the first Layer 1 (L1) programmable datachain designed to optimize both data storage and execution. By integrating storage and execution, Irys enhances the utility of blockspace, enabling a broader spectrum of web services to operate on-chain.

### Key Features of Irys

- **Unified Platform**: Combines data storage and execution, allowing developers to eliminate dependencies and integrate efficient on-chain data seamlessly.
- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Optimized specifically for data storage, making it significantly cheaper to store data on-chain compared to traditional blockchains.
- **Programmable Datachain**: The IrysVM can utilize on-chain data during computations, enabling dynamic and real-time applications.
- **Decentralization**: Designed to minimize centralization risks by distributing control.
- **Free Storage for Small Data**: Storing less than 100KB of data is free.
- **GraphQL Querying**: Metadata stored on Irys can be queried using GraphQL.

### GraphQL Query Examples

The plugin uses GraphQL to retrieve transaction metadata. Here's an example query structure:

```graphql
query {
  transactions(owners: ["0x1234567890", "0x0987654321"]) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## API Reference

### IrysService

The main service provided by this plugin implements the following interface:

```typescript
interface IrysService {
    uploadStringToIrys(data: string): Promise<string>;
    getDataFromAnAgent(agentsWalletPublicKeys: string[]): Promise<string>;
}
```

#### Methods

- `uploadStringToIrys(data: string)`: Uploads a string to Irys and returns the transaction URL
- `getDataFromAnAgent(agentsWalletPublicKeys: string[])`: Retrieves all data associated with the given wallet addresses
