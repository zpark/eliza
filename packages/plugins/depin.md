# @elizaos/plugin-depin

## Purpose

Empowers the Eliza Agent Framework with Perception and Action capabilities via Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs), bridging digital AI intelligence with the physical world.

## Key Features

1. Seamless IoTeX Integration: Leverages IoTeX Modular Infra to connect to DePIN networks
2. Unified Data Access: Standardized interfaces for diverse DePIN data sources
3. Time-Series Data Handling: Equipped to analyze temporal patterns
4. Future-Proof Design: Designed to scale with evolving DePIN and AI landscape

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
SENTAI_API_KEY=your-sentai-api-key
```

### Character Configuration

```json
"plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-depin"
]
```

## Integration

Serves as a critical component for Eliza agents to become sentient systems by enabling them to:

- Perceive: Access sensory data streams from devices across decentralized networks
- Act: Influence and control connected devices in real-time
- Learn: Build predictive models using continuous feedback from real-world data sources

## Example Usage

### DePIN Projects

- Token metrics queries
- Project comparisons
- Filtering by categories or blockchain platforms
- Device and revenue analysis
- In-depth queries about specific projects

### Sentient AI

- Real-time weather updates (supported by Nubila)
- Forecast analysis (supported by Nubila)
- Additional actions based on DePIN data (future development)
